SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'LONDON 1895'

DIRECTION:
SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'THE RESIDENCE OF MR OSCAR WILDE'

DIRECTION:
Suitably classy music starts. Mix through to Wilde's drawing room. A crowd of suitably dressed folk are engaged in typically brilliant conversation, laughing affectedly and drinking champagne.

TERRY JONES:
My congratulations, Wilde. Your latest play is a great success. The whole of London's talking about you.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.

DIRECTION:
There follows fifteen seconds of restrained and sycophantic laughter.

TERRY JONES:
Very very witty ... very

DIRECTION:
very

TERRY JONES:
witty.

JOHN CLEESE:
There is only one thing in the world worse than being witty, and that is not being witty.

DIRECTION:
Fifteeen more seconds of the same.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I wish I had said that.

JOHN CLEESE:
You will, Oscar, you will.

DIRECTION:
more laughter

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Your Majesty, have you met James McNeill Whistler?

TERRY JONES:
Yes, we've played squash together.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
There is only one thing worse than playing squash together, and that is playing it by yourself.

DIRECTION:
silence

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I wish I hadn't said that.

JOHN CLEESE:
You did, Oscar, you did.

DIRECTION:
a little laughter

TERRY JONES:
I've got to get back up the Palace.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Your Majesty is like a big jam doughnut with cream on the top.

TERRY JONES:
I beg your pardon?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Um ... It was one of Whistler's.

JOHN CLEESE:
I never said that.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You did, James, you did.

DIRECTION:
The Prince of Wales stares expectantly at Whistler.

JOHN CLEESE:
... Well, Your Highness, what I meant was that, like a doughnut, um, your arrival gives us pleasure and your departure only makes us hungry for more.

DIRECTION:
laughter

JOHN CLEESE:
Your Highness, you are also like a stream of bat's piss.

TERRY JONES:
What?

JOHN CLEESE:
It was one of Wilde's. One of Wilde's.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It sodding was not! It was Shaw!

MICHAEL PALIN:
I ... I merely meant, Your Majesty, that you shine out like a shaft of gold when all around is dark.

DIRECTION:
accepting the compliment

TERRY JONES:
Oh.

DIRECTION:
to Whistler

DIRECTION:
to Prince

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Your Majesty is like a dose of clap.

JOHN CLEESE:
Before you arrive - before you arrive is pleasure, and after is a pain in the dong.

DIRECTION:
What?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
One of Shaw's, one of Shaw's.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You bastards. Um ... what I meant, Your Majesty, what I meant ...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
We've got him, Jim.

JOHN CLEESE:
Come on, Shaw-y.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Come on, Shaw-y.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I merely meant ...

JOHN CLEESE:
Let's have a bit of wit, then, man.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Come on, Shaw-y

DIRECTION:
.

DIRECTION:
blows a raspberry

DIRECTION:
The Prince shakes Shaw's hand. Laughter all round. We then link to animation for a few minutes, then back to Dickie Attenborough at the awards ceremony. He nows has bunches of onions slung around his neck.
