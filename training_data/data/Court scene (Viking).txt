GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
8 o'clock is a peak viewing hour so naturally we tend to stick to our comedy output - unless of course there's sport - because of course we know this is popular, and popularity is what television is about. Quite frankly I'm sick and tired of people accusing us of being ratings conscious.

TERRY JONES:
Ratings conscious?

TERRY JONES:
Thank you.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Now I'm really cheesed off. I mean it's not your high-brow bleeding plays that pull in the viewers, you know.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I mean Joe Public doesn't want to sit down and watch three hours of documentaries every evening.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
He wants to sit down and he wants to be entertained, he doesn't want a load...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No really - I'm absolutely fed up with this. I really am.

TERRY JONES:
Case dismissed.

JOHN CLEESE:
Case dismissed, m'lud?

TERRY JONES:
Oh all right, five years.

JOHN CLEESE:
Thank you, m'lud.

TERRY JONES:
Call the next case please.

JOHN CLEESE:
Call Erik Njorl, son of Frothgar, brother of Hangnor...

JOHN CLEESE:
.

ERIC IDLE:
You are Erik Njorl, son of Frothgar...

TERRY JONES:
Get on with it!

ERIC IDLE:
Will you raise your right hand.

TERRY JONES:
He obviously can't raise his right hand, you silly usher person... can you raise your right leg Mr Njorl?

ERIC IDLE:
Can you raise any part of your body, Mr Njorl?

ERIC IDLE:
I see... well, we'll skip that... well, just take the book in your right hand Mr Njorl without raising any part of your body... Oh ....

TERRY JONES:
What is it now, you persistently silly usher?

ERIC IDLE:
He can't hold the Bible m'lud.

TERRY JONES:
Well screw the Bible! Let's get on with this bleeding trial, I've got a Gay Lib meeting at 6 o'clock. Superintendent Lufthansa will you please read the charge.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Is a charge strictly necessary, m'lud?

TERRY JONES:
The press is here.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh sorry! Right, here we go. You are hereby charged. One, that you did, on or about 1126, conspire to publicize a London Borough in the course of a BBC saga; two, that you were wilfully and persistently a foreigner; three, that you conspired to do things not normally considered illegal; four, that you were caught in possession of an offensive weapon, viz, the big brown table down at the police station.

TERRY JONES:
The big brown table down at the police station?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It's the best we could find, m'lud ... and five... all together now...

JOHN CLEESE:
Call Police Constable Pan-Am.

JOHN CLEESE:
Now, you are Police Constable Pan-Am?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, I shall deny that to the last breath in my body.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh. Sorry, yes.

JOHN CLEESE:
Police constable, do you recognize the defendant?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No. Never seen him before in my life.

JOHN CLEESE:
Constable, will you please tell the court in your own words what happened?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh yes!

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, anyway I clearly saw the deceased...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Defendant! Sorry. Sorry, super. I clearly saw the defendant ... doing whatever he's accused of...Red-handed. When kicked... he said: 'It's a fair ... cop, I done it all ... Right... no doubt about... that'. Then, bound as he was to the chair, he assaulted myself and three other constables while bouncing around the cell. The end.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Thank you, thank you... and for my next piece of evidence...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I think you'd better leave it there, constable.

JOHN CLEESE:
Excellent evidence, constable

TERRY JONES:
Is he in there, d'you think? . .. Hello... Hello! Defendant, are you there ... coo-ee! De-fend-ant...

TERRY JONES:
I think you'd better go and have a look, Maurice.

TERRY JONES:
I'm sorry.
