MICHAEL PALIN:
Good morning, I'd care to purchase a chicken, please.

ERIC IDLE:
Don't come here with that posh talk you nasty, stuck-up twit.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I beg your pardon?

ERIC IDLE:
A chicken, sir. Certainly.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Thank you. And how much does that work out to per pound, my good fellow?

ERIC IDLE:
Per pound, you slimy trollop, what kind of a ponce are you?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'm sorry?

ERIC IDLE:
4/6 a pound, sir, nice and ready for roasting.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I see, and I'd care to purchase some stuffing in addition, please.

ERIC IDLE:
Use your own, you great poofy poonagger!

MICHAEL PALIN:
What?

ERIC IDLE:
Ah, certainly sir, some stuffing.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, thank you.

ERIC IDLE:
'Oh, thank you' says the great queen like a la-di-dah poofta.

ERIC IDLE:
That's all right, sir, call again.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Excuse me.

ERIC IDLE:
What is it now, you great pillock?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, I can't help noticing that you insult me and then you're polite to me alternately.

ERIC IDLE:
I'm terribly sorry to hear that, sir.

MICHAEL PALIN:
That's all right. It doesn't really matter.

ERIC IDLE:
Tough titty if it did, you nasty spotted prancer.

JOHN CLEESE:
Now I did ask for tea.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
But you just said coffee.

JOHN CLEESE:
No, no, that was just my announcement, just a metaphor.

DIRECTION:
She shrugs and begins to move off. At the table just behind him we hear her complaining noisily in the background.

JOHN CLEESE:
We come...look would you mind keeping it down, please...we come as - as I said just now, to the coffee.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Here, he said it again!

JOHN CLEESE:
Shut up!
