ERIC IDLE:
Hello, I'm your new vicar. Can I interest you in any encyclopaedias?

TERRY JONES:
Ah, no thank you. We're not Church people, thank you.

ERIC IDLE:
How about brushes? Nylon or bristle? Strong-tufted, attractive colours.

TERRY JONES:
No - really, thank you, vicar.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh dear ... Turkey? Cup final tickets?

TERRY JONES:
No, no really, we're just not religious thank you.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, well. Bye bye.

TERRY JONES:
Bye bye, vicar.

ERIC IDLE:
Remember, if you do want anything... jewellery, Ascot water heaters...

TERRY JONES:
Thank you, vicar.

TERRY JONES:
It's funny, isn't it? How your best friend can just blow up like that? I mean, you wouldn't think it was medically possible, would you?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
This is where Mrs Shazam was so wrong. Exploding is a perfectly normal medical phenomenon. In many fields of medicine nowadays, a dose of dynamite can do a world of good. For instance, athlete's foot - an irritating condition - can be cured by applying a small charge of TNT between each toe.

ERIC IDLE:
Hello, I'm your new vicar, can I interest you in any of these watches, pens or biros?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No ... I'm not religious, I'm afraid.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, souvenirs, badges... a little noddy dog for the back of the car?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No thank you, vicar. Good morning.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, morning.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Now, many of the medical profession are sceptical about my work. They point to my record of treatment of athlete's foot sufferers - eighty-four dead, sixty-five severely wounded and twelve missing believed cured. But then, people laughed at Bob Hope, people laughed at my wife when she wrapped herself up in greaseproof paper and hopped into the Social Security office, but that doesn't mean that Pasteur was wrong! Look, I'll show you what I mean.
