Inspector, inspector.

JOHN CLEESE:
Uh huh.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'm terribly sorry but I was sitting on a park bench over there, took my coat off for a minute and then I found my wallet had been stolen and Â£15 taken from it.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well did you er, did you see anyone take it, anyone hanging around or...

MICHAEL PALIN:
No no, there was no one there at all. That's the trouble.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well there's not very much we can do about that, sir.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Do you want to come back to my place?

JOHN CLEESE:
... Yeah all right.

DIRECTION:
Women's Institute applauding.
