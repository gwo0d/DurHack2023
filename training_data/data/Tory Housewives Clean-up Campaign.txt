DIRECTION:
coach load of pepperpots, middle class, grey hair, Mary Whitehouse glasses; the coach says 'Tory Tours'

DIRECTION:
cut to a factory yard; some workers in brown overalls are eating sandwiches out of tins; the clock says 1:15; the coach comes swinging in in undercrank, the ladies pour out about to belt the men with umbrellas and handbags; the men flee back into factories

DIRECTION:
a man at a machine, producing something incredibly fast; a pepperpot holds an enormous sledgehammer

DIRECTION:
wide shot of factory interior; three pepperpots stand on a gantry above work floor, wearing armbands, saying 'P.P.' and dark Mary Whitehouse glasses

DIRECTION:
a group of strikers, picketing with slogans, 'Fair Pay', 'Less Profits', 'Parity', 'No Victimization'

DIRECTION:
pepperpots arrive, clinging to side of old Buick; they race in and start beating the strikers with the banners

art gallery exterior; pepperpots run in with bundles and ladders

DIRECTION:
cut to art gallery interior, pan around paintings 'cleaned up'- trousers and cardigans being added to nude pictures and statues, Bermuda shorts on David, shorts on tubular structure, an attendant in shorts too

ERIC IDLE:
. And it's not just the modern so-called plastic arts that get the clean-up treatment.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a theatre stage. Desdemona on a bed. Othello with her.

DIRECTION:
Oh Desdemona, Desdemona.

DIRECTION:
The pepperpots race on to the stage and pull him off.

ERIC IDLE:
And those continentals had better watch out for their dirty foreign literature. Jean-Paul Sartre and Jean Genet won't know what's hit them. Never mind the foulness of their language - come '73 they'll all have to write in British.

DIRECTION:
pepperpots burning books: 'Bertrand Russell', 'Das Kapital', the 'Guardian', 'Sartre', 'Freud'

ERIC IDLE:
You can keep your fastidious continental bidets Mrs Foreigner - Mrs Britain knows how to keep her feet clean ... but she'll baffle like bingo boys when it comes to keeping the television screen clean...

DIRECTION:
Cut to the BBC TV Centre. The peppetpots parade in carrying signs: 'Clean TV Centre', 'God Says No To Filth', 'To The Cells'. Another pepperpot in the background holds a sign: 'Wanted Dead Or Alive' and photo of Robert Robinson.

ERIC IDLE:
Better watch out for those nasty continental shows on the sneaky second channel.

DIRECTION:
armed pepperpots escorting people out of TV Centre

ERIC IDLE:
But apart from attacking that prurient hot-bed of left-wing continentalism at Shepherds Bush, what else do these ordinary mums think? Do they accept Hegelianism?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No! ..

ERIC IDLE:
Do they prefer Leibnitz to Wittgenstein?

TERRY JONES:
No! No!

ERIC IDLE:
And where do they stand on young people?

ERIC IDLE:
Just here, dear.

ERIC IDLE:
And their power is growing daily and when these girls roll their sleeves up its arms all the way.

DIRECTION:
pepperpots standing on the turret of an armoured vehicle; four pepperpots on motor bikes flank it

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, this is the way to fight the constant war against pornography.

DIRECTION:
Machine guns chatter. Two pepperpots in a trench firing. Mortar bombs, reloading and firing. Bombs and smoke. At the end of the film we pick up on the nude organist (Terry J), sitting amongst the explosions. He plays his chords.

JOHN CLEESE:
And now...

MICHAEL PALIN:
