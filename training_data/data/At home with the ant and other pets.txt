TERRY JONES:
What have you got now?

ERIC IDLE:
I bought an ant, mother.

TERRY JONES:
What d'you want one of them for! I'm not going to clean it out. You said you'd clean the tiger out, but do you? No, I suppose you've lost interest in it now. Now it'll be ant ant ant for a couple of days, then all of a sudden, 'oh, mum, I've bought a sloth' or some other odd-toed ungulate like a tapir.

ERIC IDLE:
It's really different this time, mum. I'm really going to look after this ant.

TERRY JONES:
That's what you said about the sperm whale... now your papa's having to use it as a garage.

ERIC IDLE:
Well, you didn't feed it properly.

TERRY JONES:
Where are we going to get forty-four tons of plankton from every morning? Your papa was dead vexed about that. They thought he was mad in the deli.

ERIC IDLE:
Well at least he's got a free garage.

TERRY JONES:
That's no good to him... his Hillman smells all fishy.

TERRY JONES:
Oh blimey, that's the tiger. He'll want his mandies.

ERIC IDLE:
Are you giving that tiger drugs?

TERRY JONES:
'

TERRY JONES:
I'm giving it drugs!

ERIC IDLE:
It's illegal.

TERRY JONES:
You try telling that to the tiger.

ERIC IDLE:
I think it's dangerous.

TERRY JONES:
Listen ... before he started fixing, he used to get through four Jehovah's witnesses a day. And he used to eat all of them, except the pamphlets.

ERIC IDLE:
Well he's not dim.

TERRY JONES:
All right!

ERIC IDLE:
Well, I'm going to watch one of the televisions... come on Marcus.

TERRY JONES:
Michael's been on the phone all day for you.

ERIC IDLE:
Michael?

TERRY JONES:
You know, Michael...

TERRY JONES:
. He's been on the phone all day ... he came round twice.

ERIC IDLE:
What did he look like?

TERRY JONES:
Oh, I didn't see him. The orange-rumped agouti answered the door. Only useful animal you ever bought, that.

ERIC IDLE:
Where is he now?

TERRY JONES:
He's upstairs forging prescriptions for the sodding tiger!

ERIC IDLE:
No, no, where is Michael Ellis now?

TERRY JONES:
Oh, I don't know... he said it wasn't important, anyway... all right, here I come.
