TERRY JONES:
What have you got now?

ERIC IDLE:
I bought an ant, mother.

TERRY JONES:
What d'you want one of them for! I'm not going to clean it out. You said you'd clean the tiger out, but do you? No, I suppose you've lost interest in it now. Now it'll be ant ant ant for a couple of days, then all of a sudden, 'oh, mum, I've bought a sloth' or some other odd-toed ungulate like a tapir.

ERIC IDLE:
It's really different this time, mum. I'm really going to look after this ant.

TERRY JONES:
That's what you said about the sperm whale... now your papa's having to use it as a garage.

ERIC IDLE:
Well, you didn't feed it properly.

TERRY JONES:
Where are we going to get forty-four tons of plankton from every morning? Your papa was dead vexed about that. They thought he was mad in the deli.

ERIC IDLE:
Well at least he's got a free garage.

DIRECTION:
growl from the tiger

TERRY JONES:
That's no good to him... his Hillman smells all fishy.

DIRECTION:
we hear a roar

TERRY JONES:
Oh blimey, that's the tiger. He'll want his mandies.

ERIC IDLE:
Are you giving that tiger drugs?

TERRY JONES:
'

DIRECTION:
Course

TERRY JONES:
I'm giving it drugs!

ERIC IDLE:
It's illegal.

TERRY JONES:
You try telling that to the tiger.

ERIC IDLE:
I think it's dangerous.

TERRY JONES:
Listen ... before he started fixing, he used to get through four Jehovah's witnesses a day. And he used to eat all of them, except the pamphlets.

ERIC IDLE:
Well he's not dim.

DIRECTION:
A very loud roar and rattling of cage.

TERRY JONES:
All right!

DIRECTION:
She loads a syringe and starts to leave.

ERIC IDLE:
Well, I'm going to watch one of the televisions... come on Marcus.

DIRECTION:
He puts Marcus in cage and is just about to take it through to the next room.

TERRY JONES:
Michael's been on the phone all day for you.

ERIC IDLE:
Michael?

TERRY JONES:
You know, Michael...

DIRECTION:
Michael

DIRECTION:
Ellis

TERRY JONES:
. He's been on the phone all day ... he came round twice.

ERIC IDLE:
What did he look like?

TERRY JONES:
Oh, I didn't see him. The orange-rumped agouti answered the door. Only useful animal you ever bought, that.

ERIC IDLE:
Where is he now?

TERRY JONES:
He's upstairs forging prescriptions for the sodding tiger!

ERIC IDLE:
No, no, where is Michael Ellis now?

TERRY JONES:
Oh, I don't know... he said it wasn't important, anyway... all right, here I come.

DIRECTION:
She goes to the tiger. Chris looks confused, then shrugs and goes into the sitting room with Marcus. In the room there are about twenty old televisions on shelves. Chris selects one of the televisions, puts it on the table, switches it on and settles down to watch it with Marcus.
