JOHN CLEESE:
Hello. 'Ow are you? I'm fine. Welcome to a new half-hour chat show in which me, viz the man what's talking to you now, and Brooky - to wit my flat mate - and nothing else, I'd like to emphasize that - discuss current affairs issues of burning import.

ERIC IDLE:
Have you heard the one about the three nuns in the nudist colony?

JOHN CLEESE:
Shut up. Tonight, the population explosion.

ERIC IDLE:
Apparently there were these three nuns...

JOHN CLEESE:
Shut up. Come the year 1991, given the present rate of increase in the world's population, the Chinese will be three deep. Another thing...

TERRY JONES:
Sorry, loves, sorry, the show is too long this week and this scene's been cut.

JOHN CLEESE:
Lord Hill's at the bottom of this.

TERRY JONES:
But if you can find a piano stool you can appear later on in the show on film.

ERIC IDLE:
'Ow much?

TERRY JONES:
Oh, about ten bob each?

JOHN CLEESE:
I wouldn't wipe me nose on it.

ERIC IDLE:
'Ave you 'eard the one about these three nuns...

JOHN CLEESE:
Shh. I can hear something. 'Ang about, we may still get in this show as a link.

ERIC IDLE:
That's clever. How do they do that?

JOHN CLEESE:
Colour separation, you cotton head.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, they seem to be in another tight spot...

JOHN CLEESE:
Well and now we move on to our, to our main course. Prawn salad...Prawn salad?
