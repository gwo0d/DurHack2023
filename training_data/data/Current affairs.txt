Hello. 'Ow are you? I'm fine. Welcome to a new half-hour chat show in which me, viz the man what's talking to you now, and Brooky - to wit my flat mate - and nothing else, I'd like to emphasize that - discuss current affairs issues of burning import.

ERIC IDLE:
Have you heard the one about the three nuns in the nudist colony?

JOHN CLEESE:
Shut up. Tonight, the population explosion.

That's clever. How do they do that?

Colour separation, you cotton head.
