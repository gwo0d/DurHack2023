TERRY JONES:
Michael Norman Randall, you have been found guilty of the murder of Arthur Reginald Webster, Charles Patrick Trumpington, Marcel Agnes Bernstein, Lewis Anona Rudd, John Malcolm Kerr, Nigel Sinclair Robinson, Norman Arthur Potter, Felicity Jayne Stone, Jean-Paul Reynard, Rachel Shirley Donaldson, Stephen Jay Greenblatt, Karl-Heinz Mullet, Belinda Anne Ventham, Juan-Carlos Fernandez, Thor Olaf Stensgaard, Lord Kimberley of Pretoria, Lady Kimberley of Pretoria, The Right Honourable Nigel Warmsly Kimberley, Robert Henry Noonan and Felix James Bennett, on or about the morning of the 19th December 1972. Have you anything to say before I pass sentence?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, sir. I'm very sorry.

TERRY JONES:
Very sorry?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, sir. It was a very very bad thing to have done and I'm really very ashamed of myself. I can only say it won't happen again. To have murdered so many people in such a short space of time is really awful, and I really am very, very, very sorry that I did it, and also that I've taken up so much of the court's valuable time listening to the sordid details of these senseless killings of mine. I would particularly like to say, a very personal and sincere 'sorry' to you, m'lud, for my appalling behaviour throughout this trial. I'd also like to say sorry to the police, for putting them to so much trouble

ERIC IDLE:
for the literally hours of work they've had to put in, collecting evidence and identifying corpses and so forth. You know I think sometimes we ought to realize the difficult and often dangerous work involved in tracking down violent criminals like myself and I'd just like them to know that their fine work is at least appreciated by me.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no, we were only doing our job.

ERIC IDLE:
It's very good of you to say that, but I know what you've been through.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no, we've had worse.

ERIC IDLE:
I know and I'm grateful. I'd like to apologize too to the prosecuting counsel for dragging him in here morning after morning in such lovely weather.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, I would have had to come in anyway.

ERIC IDLE:
Ah good, but what a presentation of a case!

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh thank you.

ERIC IDLE:
No, no, it's a privilege to watch you in action. I never had a chance.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh yes you did.

ERIC IDLE:
Not after that summing up. Great.

ERIC IDLE:
And now I must come to the jury. What can I say. I've dragged you in here, day after day, keeping you away from your homes, your jobs, your loved ones, just to hear the private details of my petty atrocities.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, no, it was very interesting.

ERIC IDLE:
But you could have had a much nicer case.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, no, murder's much more fun.

ERIC IDLE:
I'm sorry, I'm very moved. And so, m'lud, it only remains for you to pass the most savage sentence on me that the law can provide.

TERRY JONES:
Well er... not necessarily.

ERIC IDLE:
No, m'lud, the full penalty of the law is hardly sufficient. I insist I must be made an example of.

TERRY JONES:
Well yes and no. I mean society at large...

ERIC IDLE:
Oh no, m'lud. Not with mass murder.

TERRY JONES:
But in this case,

TERRY JONES:
don't you think?

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, come on, m'lud, you've got to give me life.

ERIC IDLE:
Well, ten years at least.

TERRY JONES:
Ten years!

ERIC IDLE:
Well five then. Be fair.

TERRY JONES:
No, no. I'm giving you three months.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh no, that's so embarrassing. I won't hear of it. Give me six...please.

TERRY JONES:
Well, all right. Six months.

ERIC IDLE:
Thank you, m'lud.

TERRY JONES:
But suspended.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh no.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Three cheers for the defendant. Hip. Hip.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hip. Hip.

JOHN CLEESE:
Which nobody can deny.
