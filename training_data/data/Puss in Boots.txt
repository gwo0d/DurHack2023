DIRECTION:
Enter a pantomime principal boy holding a stuffed cat. All the rest of the group break back in a well-choreographed panto arrowhead and raise their hands toward her.

DIRECTION:
It's ... Puss!

DIRECTION:
Hello, Puss!

JULIA BRECK:
Hello, children!

JOHN CLEESE:
Stop! Stop this adaptation of 'Puss-in-Boots'! This is the Police Department of the State of Venezuela!

DIRECTION:
Oh no it isn't!

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, yes it is!

DIRECTION:
kids joining in voice over

DIRECTION:
Oh no it isn't!

DIRECTION:
plus kids

DIRECTION:
Oh yes it is!

DIRECTION:
plus kids

DIRECTION:
Oh no it isn't...

JOHN CLEESE:
Shut up! Shut up!

DIRECTION:
getting up, holding a pistol; he has no trousers; silence

JOHN CLEESE:
Now I'm going to ask you some questions, and remember, if you do not give me correct answers, we have ways of making you answer!

DIRECTION:
Like not paying twenty-eight guineas.

JOHN CLEESE:
Shut up! Now, what ship are you from?

TERRY JONES:
We are from the SS Mother Goose, we were twelve days out from Port of Spain, and I ...

DIRECTION:
The door is flung open and the second - trouserless - guard rushes in.

ERIC IDLE:
I got thirty bob for the trousers!

TERRY JONES:
We are from SS Mother Goose. We were twelve days out from Port of Spain, and one night I was doing my usual rounds, when I had occasion to pass the forward storage lockers...

DIRECTION:
Slightly eerie music has crept in under his words and the screen goes into a ripple. It gets right out of focus and continues to ripple as it pulls back into focus. Ripple stops and they are still in the same set as they were.

JOHN CLEESE:
Go on!

TERRY JONES:
Well, I noticed something unusual, the main bilge hatches had been opened...

DIRECTION:
at this point three men in brown coats come in and start taking pictures off the wall, clearing props and chairs from the set, etc.

DIRECTION:
the flats start to be flown up, revealing behind a sitting room - so that we can see the police office has been built in the Kelly's sitting room

TERRY JONES:
As soon as it saw me, its horrible face split aside in a ghastly look of terror. His head, which was like ...

DIRECTION:
Could you sign this please?

DIRECTION:
handing the captain a piece of paper

DIRECTION:
Thank you.

TERRY JONES:
A small, small rat was ghastly and horrible and befurred... its little red eyes glinted in the unaccustomed glare of the midday sun and before I could shut the hatch, it sprang upon me with one almighty...

DIRECTION:
By this time the whole office set has been removed revealing the Kelly's boarding house sitting room. Mr and Mrs Kelly come in through door and put their heads round.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What's this about doing the 'Horse of the Year Show' in here tonight?

JOHN CLEESE:
I'm sorry, Mrs Kelly. We don't know, I'm afraid - this is drama.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Mr Fox told me, before he went down to the pub, that they were doing 'Horse of the Year Show' in here tonight at 9.10.

JOHN CLEESE:
This is BBC 2

DIRECTION:
.

TERRY JONES:
I think BBC 1 are in the kitchen.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, I'm not having Harvey Smith jumping over my binette.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, come on.

DIRECTION:
they go

TERRY JONES:
... tearing at my throat, ripping my clothes...

DIRECTION:
Mr Kelly puts his head round the door.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
And turn the gas off before you leave!

JOHN CLEESE:
All right!!

DIRECTION:
Mr Kelly goes.

TERRY JONES:
I fought it with all my strength, but it was too much for me...

DIRECTION:
Cut to Mr and Mrs Kelly coming through the hall. We can hear the captain's voice growing faster. Mr and Mrs Kelly go towards the kitchen door and stop and listen. We have lost the captain's voice by now, but from inside the kitchen we hear 'Horse of the Year Show' sound track.

DIRECTION:
voice over

DIRECTION:
Another clear round for Harvey Smith on 'Orealley'.

DIRECTION:
voice over on tannoy

DIRECTION:
And now it's Mrs David Barker riding 'Atalanta' Number 3.

DIRECTION:
Crash of breaking pottery, falling pots and pans, horse neighing.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right! That's it!

DIRECTION:
they throw door open and march into the kitchen; a horse plus Pat Hornsby Smith and the commentator and the wreckage of a jump

MICHAEL PALIN:
Come on now, out! All of you - get out of my kitchen, all of you - come on! Harvey Smith, get out of here!

DIRECTION:
She chases them out and down the hall.

DIRECTION:
emerging from another door

TERRY JONES:
It's one of our most popular programmes.

MICHAEL PALIN:
That's what

DIRECTION:
you

MICHAEL PALIN:
think, Mr Fox!

DIRECTION:
She shooshes them all out down the passage and out of the front door. The newsreader with a blanket over him joins them and tries to read off a piece of paper.

ERIC IDLE:
Well, that's all from BBC Television for this evening...

DIRECTION:
slamming door on him

MICHAEL PALIN:
Shove off! Go and find yourself another flat! Get out!

DIRECTION:
As she slams the door, a piece of paper (obviously a tax return form) is shoved through the door. It has the credits scribbled hurriedly on it; the camera pans into it. After the credits Mrs Kelly stamps on the paper.

DIRECTION:
Fade out.

DIRECTION:
Showbix music, cut to a sign saying 'It's'. Pull out to reveal glossy, spangly, opulent showbiz set. Two extraordinarily famous guests sitting on sofas.

ERIC IDLE:
Tonight from London your special guests are Lulu, Ringo Starr and the man you've all been waiting for - your host for tonight...

DIRECTION:
More music. The 'It's' man, tattered and ragged as usual, emerges onto set.

DIRECTION:
Love the outfit dear, it's gorgeous...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hello, good evening, welcome. It's...

DIRECTION:
The signature tune and opening animated titles start. The 'It's' man, still visible through the titles, tries in vain to stop them. The guests walk off in disgust. The 'It's' man tries to drag them back. Failing, he sits down as the music ends. Fade out.
