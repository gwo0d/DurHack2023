DIRECTION:
Cut to a small, tatty, little boarding house.

DIRECTION:
SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'A SMALL BOARDING HOUSE IN MINEHEAD, SOMERSET'

DIRECTION:
Mr and Mrs Johnson, a typical holidaying bourgeois couple walk up to the front door and ring the bell. Inside the boarding house, the landlady goes up to the front door and opens it.

TERRY JONES:
Hello, Mr and Mrs Johnson?

ERIC IDLE:
That's right. Yes.

TERRY JONES:
Well come on in, excuse me not shaking hands, I've just been putting a bit of lard on the cat's boil.

ERIC IDLE:
Very nice.

TERRY JONES:
Well you must be tired, it's a long way from Coventry, isn't it?

ERIC IDLE:
Well, we usually reckon on five and a half hours and it took us six hours and fifty-three minutes, with the twenty-five minute stop at Frampton Cottrell to stretch our legs, only we had to wait half an hour to get onto the M5 at Droitwich.

TERRY JONES:
Really?

ERIC IDLE:
Then there was a three mile queue just before Bridgewater on the A38. We usually come round on the B3339 just before Bridgewater, you see...

ERIC IDLE:
Ye, but this time we decided to risk it because they're always saying they're going to widen it there.

TERRY JONES:
Are they?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes well just by the intersection, there where the A372 joins up, there's plenty of room to widen it there, there's only grass verges. They could get another six feet...knock down that hospital... Then we took the coast road through Williton and got all the Taunton traffic on the A358 from Crowcombe and Stogumber...

TERRY JONES:
Well you must be dying for a cup of tea.

ERIC IDLE:
Well, wouldn't say no, not if it's warm and wet.

TERRY JONES:
Well come on in the lounge, I'm just going to serve afternoon tea.

DIRECTION:
following her into the lounge

DIRECTION:
In the lounge are sitting another bourgeois couple Mr and Mrs Phillips.

TERRY JONES:
Come on in, Mr and Mrs Johnson, oh this is Mr and Mrs Phillips.

TERRY GILLIAM:
Good afternoon.

ERIC IDLE:
Thank you.
