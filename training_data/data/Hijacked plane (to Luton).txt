MICHAEL PALIN:
All right, don't anybody move ... except to control the aeroplane ... you can move a little to do that.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Can I move?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, yes, yes. You can move a little bit. Yes. Sorry, I didn't mean to be so dogmatic when I came in. Obviously you can all move a little within reason. There are certain involuntary muscular movements which no amount of self-control can prevent. And obviously any assertion of authority on my part, I've got to take that into account.

JOHN CLEESE:
Right. I mean one couldn't for example, stop one's insides from moving.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, no. Good point, good point.

JOHN CLEESE:
And the very fact that the plane is continuously vibrating means that we're all moving to a certain extent.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And we're all moving our lips, aren't we?

JOHN CLEESE:
Absolutely.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, the gist of my meaning was that sudden... er...

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Exaggerated movements ...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Exaggerated

MICHAEL PALIN:
movements... are... are out.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, that's the great thing about these modern airliners. I mean, I can keep this plane flying with only the smallest movement and Pancho here doesn't have to move at all.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, that's marvellous.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
And I don't really need to move either ... unless I get an itch or something...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well that's wonderful ... 60% success, eh?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Anyway, bearing all that in mind, will you fly this plane to Luton, please?

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, this is a scheduled flight to Cuba.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I know, I know, that's rather why I came in here with that point about nobody moving.

TERRY JONES:
Within reason.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Within reason - yes. I... er ... er... you know, I want you to fly this plane to Luton ... please.

JOHN CLEESE:
Right, well I'd better turn the plane round then. Stand by emergency systems.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Look I don't want to cause any trouble.,

JOHN CLEESE:
No, no, we'll manage, we'll manage.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I mean, near Luton will do, you know. Harpenden, do you go near Harpenden?

TERRY JONES:
It's on the flight path.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Okay, well, drop me off there. I'll get a bus to Luton. It's only twenty-five minutes.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
You can be in Luton by lunchtime.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, well that's smashing.

TERRY JONES:
Hang on! There's no airport at Harpenden.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh well, look, forget it. Forget it. I'll come to Cuba, and get a flight back to Luton from there.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, we could lend you a parachute.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, no, no, no, no. I wouldn't dream of it... wouldn't dream of it... dirtying a nice, clean parachute.

TERRY JONES:
I know - I know. There's a bale of hay outside Basingstoke. We could throw you out.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, if it's all right.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Not any trouble?

MICHAEL PALIN:
That's marvellous. Thank you very much. Sorry to come barging in.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Bye-bye.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Thank you. Bye.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Thank you!

JOHN CLEESE:
Take this bus to Cuba.

JOHN CLEESE:
From these glens and scars, the sound of the coot and the moorhen is seldom absent. Nature sits in stern mastery over these rocks and crags. The rush of the mountain stream, the bleat of the sheep, and the broad, clear Highland skies, reflected in turn and loch ...

JOHN CLEESE:
... form the breathtaking backdrop against which Ewan McTeagle writes such poems as 'Lend us a quid till the end of the week'.

JOHN CLEESE:
But it was with more simple, homespun verses that McTeagle's unique style first flowered.

TERRY JONES:
If you could see your way to lending me sixpence. I could at least buy a newspaper. That's not much to ask anyone.

JOHN CLEESE:
One woman who remembers McTeagle as a young friend - Lassie O'Shen.

ERIC IDLE:
Mr MeTeagle wrote me two poems, between the months of January and April 1969...

ERIC IDLE:
Och, I dinna like to... they were kinda personal... but I will.

ERIC IDLE:
'To Ma Own beloved Lassie. A poem on her 17th Birthday. Lend us a couple of bob till Thursday. I'm absolutely skint. But I'm expecting a postal order and I can pay you back as soon as it comes. Love Ewan.'

JOHN CLEESE:
Since then, McTeagle has developed and widened his literary scope. Three years ago he concerned himself with quite small sums - quick bits of ready cash: sixpences, shillings, but more recently he has turned his extraordinary literary perception to much larger sums - fifteen shillings, Â£4.12.6 ... even nine guineas ... But there is still nothing to match the huge sweep ... the majestic power of what is surely his greatest work: 'Can I have fifty pounds to mend the shed?'.

ERIC IDLE:
Can I have fifty pounds to mend the shed?

JOHN CLEESE:
There seems to be no end to McTeagle's poetic invention. 'My new cheque book hasn't arrived' was followed up by the brilliantly allegorical 'What's twenty quid to the bloody Midland Bank?' and more recently his prizewinning poem to the Arts Council: 'Can you lend me one thousand quid?'

MICHAEL PALIN:
I think what McTeagle's pottery... er... poetry is doing is

MICHAEL PALIN:
all the traditional cliches of modern pottery. No longer do we have to be content with Keats's 'Seasons of mists and mellow fruitfulness', Wordsworth's 'I wandered lonely as a cloud' and Milton's 'Can you lend us two bob till Tuesday'...

JOHN CLEESE:
As a Highlander I would like to complain about some inaccuracies in the preceding film about the poet Ewan McTeagle. Although his name was quite clearly given as McTeagle, he was throughout wearing the Cameron tartan. Also I would like to point out that the BALPA spokesman who complained about aeronautical inaccuracies was himself wearing a captain's hat, whereas he only had lieutenant's stripes on the sleeves of his jacket. Also, in the Inverness pantomime last Christmas, the part of Puss in Boots was played by a native of New Guinea with a plate in her lip, so that every time Dick Whittington gave her a French kiss, he got the back of his throat scraped.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Look, would you mind going away, I'm trying to examine this man.

MICHAEL PALIN:
a doctor. Actually, I'm a gynaecologist... but this is my lunchhour.
