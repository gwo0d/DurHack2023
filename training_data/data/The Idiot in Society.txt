DIRECTION:
A village idiot in smock and straw hat, red cheeks, straw in mouth, sitting on a wall, making funny noises and rolling his eyes.

ERIC IDLE:
Arthur Figgis is an idiot. A village idiot. Tonight we look at the idiot in society.

DIRECTION:
Cut to close-up of Figgis talking to camera. Very big close-up losing the top and bottom of his head.

DIRECTION:
educated voice

DIRECTION:
suddenly switches to rural accent

DIRECTION:
vicar passes and gives him sixpence

DIRECTION:
passing lady gives him sixpence

JOHN CLEESE:
Thank you, Mrs Thompson... this is the role that I and members of my family have fulfilled in this village for the past four hundred years... Good morning, Mr Jenkins, ICI have increased their half-yearly dividend, I see.

DIRECTION:
We see Mr Jenkins pass, he is also an idiot, identically dressed.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, splendid.

JOHN CLEESE:
That's Mr Jenkins - he's another idiot. And so you see the idiot does provide a vital psycho-social service for this community. Oh, excuse me, a coach party has just arrived. I shall have to fall off the wall, I'm afraid.

DIRECTION:
He falls backwards off the wall. Cut to Figgins in idiot's costume coming out of a suburban home. He walks on to the lawn on which are several pieces of gym equipment. He runs head-on into horse (speeded up) and falls over, concussed.

ERIC IDLE:
Arthur takes idiotting seriously. He is up at six o'clock every morning working on special training equipment designed to keep him silly. And of course he takes great pride in his appearance.

DIRECTION:
Figgis, dressed in nice clean smock, jumps into a pond. He immediately scrambles up, pulls out a mirror and pats mud an his face critically, as if making-up.

ERIC IDLE:
Like the doctor, the blacksmith, the carpenter, Mr Figgis is an important figure in this village and - like them - he uses the local bank.

DIRECTION:
Village square. A bank. Figgis is walking towards it. People giggling and pointing. He goes into a silly routine. Figgis enters the bank. Cut to bank manager standing outside bank.

DIRECTION:
CAPTION: 'M. BRANDO - BANK MANAGER'

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, we have quite a number of idiots banking here.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What kind of money is there in idioting?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well nowadays a really blithering idiot can make anything up to ten thousand pounds a year - if he's the head of some big industrial combine. But of course, the more old-fashioned idiot still refuses to take money.

DIRECTION:
We see Figgis handing over a cheque to cashier; cashier pushes across a pile of moss, pebbles, bits of wood and acorns.

DIRECTION:
voice over

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
He takes bits of string, wood, dead budgerigars, sparrows, anything, but it does make the cashier's job very difficult; but of course they're fools to themselves because the rate of interest over ten years on a piece of moss or a dead vole is almost negligible.

DIRECTION:
A clerk appears at door of bank.

TERRY JONES:
Mr Brando.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes?

TERRY JONES:
Hollywood on the phone.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'll take it in the office.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a woodland glade.

ERIC IDLE:
But Mr Figgis is no ordinary idiot. He is a lecturer in idiocy at the University of East Anglia. Here he is taking a class of third-year students.

DIRECTION:
Half a dozen loonies led by Figgis come dancing through the glade singing tunelessly. They are wearing long University scarves.

ERIC IDLE:
After three years of study these apprentice idiots receive a diploma of idiocy, a handful of mud and a kick on the head.

DIRECTION:
A vice-chancellor stands in a University setting with some young idiots in front of him. They wear idiot gear with BA hoods. One walks forward to him, he gets a diploma, a faceful of mud and stoops to receive his kick on the head. Cut to happy parents smiling proudly.

ERIC IDLE:
But some of the older idiots resent the graduate idiot.

ERIC IDLE:
I'm a completely self-taught idiot. I mean, ooh arh, nob arhh, nob arhh .... nobody does that anymore. Anybody who did that round here would be laughed off the street. No, nowadays people want something wittier.

DIRECTION:
Wife empties breakfast over him. Cut to idiot falling repeatedly off a wall.

ERIC IDLE:
Kevin O'Nassis works largely with walls.

DIRECTION:
voice over

JOHN CLEESE:
You've got to know what you're doing. I mean, some people think I'm mad. The villagers say I'm mad, the tourists say I'm mad, well I am mad, but I'm naturally mad. I don't use any chemicals.

ERIC IDLE:
But what of the idiot's private life? How about his relationship with women?

DIRECTION:
Idiot in bed. Pull back to reveal he shares it with two very young, thin, nude girls.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well I may be an idiot but I'm no fool.

ERIC IDLE:
But the village idiot's dirty smock and wall-falling are a far cry from the modern world of the urban idiot.

DIRECTION:
stock film of city gents in their own clothes pouring out of trains

ERIC IDLE:
What kinds of backgrounds do these city idiots come from?

DIRECTION:
Vox pops film of city gents. Subtitles explain their exaggerated accents.

JOHN CLEESE:
Eton, Sandhurst and the Guards, ha, ha, ha, ha.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I can't remember but I've got it written down some where.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Daddy's a banker. He needed a wastepaper basket.

TERRY JONES:
Father was Home Secretary and mother won the Derby.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a commentator with mike in close-up. Pull back in his speech, to discover he is standing in front of the main gate at Lords cricket ground.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
The headquarters of these urban idiots is here in St John's Wood. Inside they can enjoy the company of other idiots and watch special performances of ritual idioting.

DIRECTION:
Cut to quick wide-shot of cricket match being played at Lords. Cut to five terribly old idiots watching.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well left.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well played.

ERIC IDLE:
Well well.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well bred.

DIRECTION:
dies

TERRY JONES:
Ah!
