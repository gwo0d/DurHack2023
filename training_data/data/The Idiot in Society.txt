ERIC IDLE:
Arthur Figgis is an idiot. A village idiot. Tonight we look at the idiot in society.

JOHN CLEESE:
Thank you, Mrs Thompson... this is the role that I and members of my family have fulfilled in this village for the past four hundred years... Good morning, Mr Jenkins, ICI have increased their half-yearly dividend, I see.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, splendid.

JOHN CLEESE:
That's Mr Jenkins - he's another idiot. And so you see the idiot does provide a vital psycho-social service for this community. Oh, excuse me, a coach party has just arrived. I shall have to fall off the wall, I'm afraid.

ERIC IDLE:
Arthur takes idiotting seriously. He is up at six o'clock every morning working on special training equipment designed to keep him silly. And of course he takes great pride in his appearance.

ERIC IDLE:
Like the doctor, the blacksmith, the carpenter, Mr Figgis is an important figure in this village and - like them - he uses the local bank.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, we have quite a number of idiots banking here.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What kind of money is there in idioting?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well nowadays a really blithering idiot can make anything up to ten thousand pounds a year - if he's the head of some big industrial combine. But of course, the more old-fashioned idiot still refuses to take money.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
He takes bits of string, wood, dead budgerigars, sparrows, anything, but it does make the cashier's job very difficult; but of course they're fools to themselves because the rate of interest over ten years on a piece of moss or a dead vole is almost negligible.

TERRY JONES:
Mr Brando.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes?

TERRY JONES:
Hollywood on the phone.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'll take it in the office.

ERIC IDLE:
But Mr Figgis is no ordinary idiot. He is a lecturer in idiocy at the University of East Anglia. Here he is taking a class of third-year students.

ERIC IDLE:
After three years of study these apprentice idiots receive a diploma of idiocy, a handful of mud and a kick on the head.

ERIC IDLE:
But some of the older idiots resent the graduate idiot.

ERIC IDLE:
I'm a completely self-taught idiot. I mean, ooh arh, nob arhh, nob arhh .... nobody does that anymore. Anybody who did that round here would be laughed off the street. No, nowadays people want something wittier.

ERIC IDLE:
Kevin O'Nassis works largely with walls.

JOHN CLEESE:
You've got to know what you're doing. I mean, some people think I'm mad. The villagers say I'm mad, the tourists say I'm mad, well I am mad, but I'm naturally mad. I don't use any chemicals.

ERIC IDLE:
But what of the idiot's private life? How about his relationship with women?

JOHN CLEESE:
Well I may be an idiot but I'm no fool.

ERIC IDLE:
But the village idiot's dirty smock and wall-falling are a far cry from the modern world of the urban idiot.

ERIC IDLE:
What kinds of backgrounds do these city idiots come from?

JOHN CLEESE:
Eton, Sandhurst and the Guards, ha, ha, ha, ha.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I can't remember but I've got it written down some where.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Daddy's a banker. He needed a wastepaper basket.

TERRY JONES:
Father was Home Secretary and mother won the Derby.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
The headquarters of these urban idiots is here in St John's Wood. Inside they can enjoy the company of other idiots and watch special performances of ritual idioting.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well left.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well played.

ERIC IDLE:
Well well.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well bred.

TERRY JONES:
Ah!
