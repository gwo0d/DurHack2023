same head

DIRECTION:
five

DIRECTION:
he is gradually straightening up with a visionary gleam in his eyes

DIRECTION:
he tears off his barber's jacket, to reveal tartan shirt and lumberjack trousers underneath; as he speaks the lights dim behind him and a choir of Mounties is heard, faintly in the distance

DIRECTION:
moves to stand infront of back-drop of Canadian mountains and forests

DIRECTION:
a frail adoring blonde, the heroine of many a mountains film, or perhaps the rebel maid, rushes to his side and looks adoringly into his eyes

MICHAEL PALIN:
We'd sing ... sing ... sing.

DIRECTION:
The choir is loud by now and music as well.

DIRECTION:
singing

DIRECTION:
I sleep all night and I work all day

DIRECTION:
Light comes up to his left to reveal a choir of Mounties.

DIRECTION:
He's a lumberjack, and he's OK,

DIRECTION:
He sleeps all night and he works all day.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I cut down trees, I eat my lunch,

DIRECTION:
I go to the lavatory.

DIRECTION:
On Wednesdays I go shopping,

DIRECTION:
And have buttered scones for tea.

DIRECTION:
He cuts down trees, He eats his lunch,

DIRECTION:
He goes to the lavatory.

DIRECTION:
On Wednesdays he goes shopping,

DIRECTION:
And have buttered scones for tea.

DIRECTION:
He's a lumberjack, and he's OK,

DIRECTION:
He sleeps all night and he works all day.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I cut down trees, I skip and jump,

DIRECTION:
I like to press wild flowers.

DIRECTION:
I put on women's clothing,

DIRECTION:
And hang around in bars.

DIRECTION:
He cuts down trees, he skips and jumps,

DIRECTION:
He likes to press wild flowers.

DIRECTION:
He puts on women's clothing

DIRECTION:
And hangs around.... In bars???????

DIRECTION:
During the last verse the choir has started to look uncomfortable but they brighten up as they go into the chorus.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I chop down trees, I wear high heels,

DIRECTION:
Suspenders and a bra.

DIRECTION:
I wish I'd been a girlie

DIRECTION:
Just like my dear Mama.

DIRECTION:
He cuts down trees, he wears high heels

DIRECTION:
spoken rather than sung

DIRECTION:
Suspenders and a .... a Bra????

DIRECTION:
They all mumble. Music runs down. The girl looks horrified and bursts into tears.

MICHAEL PALIN:
...just like my dear Mama.

CONNIE BOOTH:
Oh Bevis! And I thought you were so rugged.

DIRECTION:
Cut to hand-written letter.

JOHN CLEESE:
Dear Sir, I wish to complain in the strongest possible terms about the song which you have just broadcast, about the lumberjack who wears women's clothes. Many of my best friends are lumberjacks and only a few of them are transvestites. Yours faithfully, Brigadier Sir Charles Arthur Strong (Mrs.) PS I have never kissed the editor of the Radio Times.

DIRECTION:
Cut to pepperpot.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well I object to all this sex on the television. I mean I keep falling off.
