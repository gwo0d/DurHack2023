ERIC IDLE:
Before we hear the joint winner, let's see the one that came sixth. Let us see Pier Paolo Pasolini's latest film.

DIRECTION:
Close up of grass on cricket pitch. In the background we hear the buzzing of insects. A cricket ball rolls into shot and a hand reaches down and picks it up. Pull out to reveal he is a bowler, behind him a couple of fielders. He is shot from low down.

DIRECTION:
CAPTION: 'PASOLINI'S THE THIRD TEST MATCH'

DIRECTION:
Close up on the bowler as he turns to look at his field. Cut to a skeleton on the boundary in tattered remnants of cricket gear. Noise of flies buzzing becomes louder. Sounds of mocking laughter. Cut to the bowler in close up turning in the direction of the laughter. Shot of the batsman at his crease, but behind him the wicket keeper and first slip are monks in brown cowls. They are laughing at him. Cut back to the bowler's horrified eyes, he looks again. Cut to the same shot of the batsman only now the wicket keeper and first slip are cricketers again. Wind, buzzing. Cut back to the bowler, who starts to rub the ball on his trousers. Music comes in. Close up bowler's face starting to sweat. Close up ball rubbing on trousers. Close up face sweating. Cut to a girl in the pavilion licking her lips. Cut back to ball rubbing. Cut to his sweating face. Cut to girl. Cut back to bowler as he starts his run. Close up of bowler running. He runs over a couple making love in the nude. Mounting music. Cut back to the bowler, as he releases ball. Cut to the ball smashing into stumps. The music reaches crescendo. Silence. In slow motion the bowler turns, arms outstretched to the umpire. The umpire turns into a cardinal who produces a cross and holds it up like a dismissal sign.

DIRECTION:
Cut to vociferous group of cricketers in a TV studio. They are all in pads and white flannels. They are on staggered rostra as in 'Talk-back'. Facing them is Pier Paolo Pasolini.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
There's lots of people making love, but no mention af Geoff Boyott's average.

MICHAEL PALIN:
...the symbol of man's regeneration through radical Marxism...fair enough...but we never once get a chance to see him turn his off-breaks on that Brisbane sticky.

ERIC IDLE:
Aye, and what were all that dancing through Ray Illingworth's innings? Forty-seven not out and the bird comes up and feed him some grapes!
