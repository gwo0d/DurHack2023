DIRECTION:
Cut to Michael on small stage as before, this time also with Graham. Michael puts a finger up Graham's nostril: we hear the Marseillaise. He removes it: the music stops. He puts a finger up Graham's other nostril, and we hear rewinding noises.

DIRECTION:
and CAPTION:

JOHN CLEESE:
'AND NOW IN STEREO...'

DIRECTION:
Michael simultaneously puts a finger up his own nostril and a finger (on the other hand) up Graham's; we hear two recordings of the Marseillaise together (out of sync).
