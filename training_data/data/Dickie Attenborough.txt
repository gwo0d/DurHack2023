ERIC IDLE:
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Chairman, friends of the society, your dummy Royal Highness. Once again, the year has come full circle, and for me there can be no greater privilege, and honour, than to that to which it is my lot to have befallen this evening. There can be no finer honour than to welcome into our midst tonight a guest who has not only done only more than not anyone for our Society, but nontheless has only done more. He started in the film industry in 1924, he started again in 1946, and finally in 1963. He has been dead for four years, but he has not let that prevent him from coming here this evening.

he gets out an onion and holds it to his eyes; tears pour out

ERIC IDLE:
Ladies and gentlemen, no welcome could be more heartfelt than that which I have no doubt you will all want to join with me in giving this great showbiz stiff. Ladies and gentlemen, to read the nominations for the Light Entertainment Award, the remains of the late Sir Alan Waddle.

DIRECTION:
There is awful continuity music. Terrific applause. Attenborough weeps profusely. A man in a brown coat comes in carrying a white five-foot plinth. He puts it down. Behind him comes another man carrying a bronze funeral urn. It has a black tie on. Cut to stock film of the audience standing in rapturous applause. The urn is put on top of the plinth and a microphone is placed in front of it. Slight pause. Cut to Dickie weeping profusely. The urn clears its throat.

DIRECTION:
silly voice

DIRECTION:
zoom quickly in to film on the screen of the lady of Brussels throwing ink all over Mr Heath; cut back to the hall for applause

DIRECTION:
Mr Richard Baker for Lemon Curry.

DIRECTION:
Cut to Richard Baker

DIRECTION:
Lemon Curry?

Cut back to the urn.

DIRECTION:
And the Third Parachute Brigade Amateur Dramatic Society for the Oscar Wilde skit.
