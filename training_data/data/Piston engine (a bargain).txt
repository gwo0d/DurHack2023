on radio

DIRECTION:
Morning Mrs Non-Robinson.

DIRECTION:
Been shopping?

DIRECTION:
No, ... I've been shopping.

DIRECTION:
During this exchange there have been six cuts to close-ups of radios of different shapes and sizes.

DIRECTION:
What'd you buy?

DIRECTION:
Pull out to reveal a pepperpot. Mrs Non-Gorilla sitting beside a radio on a park bench.

DIRECTION:
A piston engine.

DIRECTION:
What d'you buy that for?

DIRECTION:
It was a bargain.

ERIC IDLE:
Bloody rubbish.

DIRECTION:
she turns the radio off

DIRECTION:
Quick cut to a hospital, doctor on a bed listening to a radio. It switches off.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I wanted to listen to that!

DIRECTION:
Cut back to Mrs Non-Gorilla. Another pepperpot approaches.

ERIC IDLE:
Morning Mrs Gorilla.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Morning Mrs Non-Gorilla.

ERIC IDLE:
Have you been shopping?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No ... been shopping.

ERIC IDLE:
Did you buy anything?

MICHAEL PALIN:
A piston engine!

DIRECTION:
She reveals a six-cylinder car engine on a white tray, on a trolley.

ERIC IDLE:
What d'you buy that for?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oooh! It was a bargain.

DIRECTION:
Start to pan away from them, their voices become fainter.

ERIC IDLE:
Oooohhh!

DIRECTION:
Pan across a civic park, of which the only occupants are about ten pepperpots, dressed identically, scattered across on benches. One pepperpot is in a wheelchair. We come in to Mrs Non-Smoker, unwrapping a parcel and calling to the birds.

TERRY JONES:
Come on little birdies ... come on little birdies ... tweet tweet ... come and see what mummy's got for you ...

DIRECTION:
She unwraps the parcel revealing a leg of lamb which she hurls at the gathered birds. A screech. She kills a pigeon. She reaches in a another bag and produces two tins of pineapple chunks and throws them.

TERRY JONES:
Come on little birdies ... tweety tweety ... oooh look at this ... tweet tweet ... ooohhh nice one ... come on little birdies ...

DIRECTION:
She chortles with delight as she hurls a huge jar of mayonnaise which smashes messily. She then throws a large frozen turkey, a jar of onions, a bag of frozen peas, and a bottle of wine. We widen as Mrs Smoker, with an identical piston engine to the last pepperpot, comes up to Mrs Non-Smoker. Quite a large area in front of Mrs Non-Smoker is littered with packaged foods and dead birds; a bird is pecking at a tin of pate; a small pond in front of her has a swan upside down with its feet sticking in the air, a huge tin floating beside it.

TERRY JONES:
Oohh hello, Mrs Smoker.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Hello Mrs Non-Smoker.

TERRY JONES:
What, you been shopping then?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Nope ... I've been shopping!

TERRY JONES:
What d'you buy?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
A piston engine!

TERRY JONES:
What d'you buy that for?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It was a bargain!

TERRY JONES:
How much d'you want for it?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Three quid!

TERRY JONES:
Done.

DIRECTION:
she hands over the money

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Right. Thank you.

TERRY JONES:
How d'you cook it?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You don't cook it.

TERRY JONES:
You can't eat that raw!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ooooh ... never thought of that. Oh, day and night, but this is wondrous strange ...

TERRY JONES:
... and therefore is a stranger welcome it. There are more things in Heaven and Earth Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come, the time is out of joint. Oh cursed spite, that ever I was born to set it right. Let's go together.

DIRECTION:
They get up and go. Fade to black.
