CAPTION: 'CHAMRAN KNEBT'

DIRECTION:
Pull out a little. The board has little green curtains and there is a pepperpot standing in front of it.

JOHN CLEESE:
Mrs Scab, you have twelve hours to beat the clock.

DIRECTION:
A gong rings. A superimposed clock starts to move incredibly fast. It has a minute hand and an hour hand. Twelve hours pass very quickly. The pepperpot starts to rearrange the letters, very quickly. She gets it right. It reads: 'merchant bank'. The gong again and and the clock stops.

JOHN CLEESE:
Correct!

TERRY JONES:
I've done it. I've done it. Ha, ha, ha!

DIRECTION:
An enormous head of a large cartoon-type hammer hits her and she goes down very fast.
