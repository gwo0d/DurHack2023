JOHN CLEESE:
Hello again, and welcome to the show. Tonight we continue to look at some famous deaths. Tonight we start with the wonderful death of Genghis Khan, conqueror of India. Take it away Genghis.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
9.1, 9.3, 9.7, that's 28.1 for Genghis Khan.

JOHN CLEESE:
Bad luck Genghis. Nice to have you on the show. And now here are the scores.

ERIC IDLE:
Well there you can see the scores now. St Stephen in the lead there with his stoning, then comes King Richard the Third at Bosworth Field, a grand death that, then the very lovely Jean d'Arc, then Marat in his bath - best of friends with Charlotte in the showers afterwards - then A. Lincoln of the U.S of A, a grand little chap that, and number six Genghis Khan, and the back marker King Edward the Seventh. Back to you, Wolfgang.

JOHN CLEESE:
Thank you, Eddie. And now time for this week's request death.

JOHN CLEESE:
For Mr and Mrs Violet Stebbings of 23 Wolverston Road, Hull, the death of Mr Bruce Foster of Guildford.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Strewth!

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh blimey, how time flies. Sadly we are reaching the end of yet another programme and so it is finale time. We are proud to be bringing to you one of the evergreen bucket kickers. Yes, the wonderful death of the famous English Admiral Nelson.
