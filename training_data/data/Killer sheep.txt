It's an entirely new strain of sheep, a killer sheep that can not only hold a rifle but is also a first-class shot.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
But where are they coming from, professor?

ERIC IDLE:
That I don't know. I just don't know. I really just don't know. I'm afraid I really just don't know. I'm afraid even I really just don't know. I have to tell you I'm afraid even I really just don't know. I'm afraid I have to tell you...

TERRY GILLIAM:

ERIC IDLE:
Look of fear!

ERIC IDLE:
Another strange line. Look out, Miss Garter Oil!

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Professor! What is it? What have you seen?

ERIC IDLE:
Look - there, in the doorway.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Urghhh! Arthur X! Leader of the Pennine Gang!

MICHAEL PALIN:
