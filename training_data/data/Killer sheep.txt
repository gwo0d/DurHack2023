DIRECTION:
Poster: 'Wanted For Armed Robbery - Basil' with a picture of a sheep. Exciting crime-type music. Mix through to newspaper headlines: 'Farmers Ambushed in Pen', 'Merino Ram in Wages Grab'. Eerie science fiction music; mix through to a laboratory. A scientist looking through microscope and his busty attractive assistant.

ERIC IDLE:
It's an entirely new strain of sheep, a killer sheep that can not only hold a rifle but is also a first-class shot.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
But where are they coming from, professor?

ERIC IDLE:
That I don't know. I just don't know. I really just don't know. I'm afraid I really just don't know. I'm afraid even I really just don't know. I have to tell you I'm afraid even I really just don't know. I'm afraid I have to tell you...

DIRECTION:
she hands him a glass of water which she had been busy getting as soon as he started into this speech

DIRECTION:
resuming normal breezy voice

ERIC IDLE:
... I don't know. Our only clue is this portion of wolf's clothing which the killer sheep ...

DIRECTION:
Cut to Viking.

TERRY GILLIAM:
... was wearing...

DIRECTION:
Cut back to sketch.

ERIC IDLE:
... in yesterday's raid on Selfridges.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
I'll carry out tests on it straight away, professor.

DIRECTION:
She opens a door to another lab; but it is full of cricketers.

JOHN CLEESE:
Hello, is the third test in here, please?

DIRECTION:
She slams the door on them.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Professor, there are some cricketers in the laboratory.

ERIC IDLE:
This may be even more serious than even I had at first been imagining. What a strange... strange line. There's no time to waste. Get me the Chief Commissioner of Police.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Yes, sir!

DIRECTION:
She opens a cupboard and slides out the Chief Commissioner of Police on a sort of slab. He grins and waves cheerily. 'This is Your Life' music and applause.

ERIC IDLE:
No, no, on the phone.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh...

DIRECTION:
she pushes him back in

ERIC IDLE:
Look of fear!

DIRECTION:
he is staring transfixed at something in the doorway

ERIC IDLE:
Another strange line. Look out, Miss Garter Oil!

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Professor! What is it? What have you seen?

ERIC IDLE:
Look - there, in the doorway.

DIRECTION:
Cut to doorway: through it is animation of a huge sheep with an eye patch.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Urghhh! Arthur X! Leader of the Pennine Gang!

DIRECTION:
ANIMATION:

DIRECTION:
perhaps even mixed with stock film - as the fevered mind of Gilliam takes it - sheep armed to the teeth, sheep executing dangerous raids, Basil Cassidy and the Sundance Sheep, sheep with machine gun coming out of its arse etc.

DIRECTION:
At the end of the animation, cut to studio. A narrator sitting in what could be a news set at a desk.

MICHAEL PALIN:
But soon the killer sheep began to infect other animals with its startling intelligence. Pussy cats began to arrange mortgages, cocker spaniels began to design supermarkets...

DIRECTION:
Cut back to the aninmation again: a parrot.
