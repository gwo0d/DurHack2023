MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh good, that'll be the Vet, dear.

TERRY JONES:
I'd better go and let him in.

TERRY JONES:
It's the Vet, dear.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh very glad indeed you could come round, sir.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Not at all. Now what seems to be the problem? You can tell me - I'm a Vet, you know.

TERRY JONES:
See! Tell him, dear.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well...

TERRY JONES:
It's our cat. He doesn't do anything. He just sits out there on the lawn.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Is he ... dead?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, no!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Thank God for that. For one ghastly moment I thought I was... too late. If only more people would call in the nick of time.

TERRY JONES:
He just sits there, all day and every day.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And at night.

TERRY JONES:
Sh! Almost motionless. We have to take his food out to him.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And his milk.

TERRY JONES:
Sh! He doesn't do anything. He just sits there.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Are you at your wits' end?

TERRY JONES:
Definitely, yes.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Hm. I see. Well I think I may be able to help you. You see ...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
... your cat is suffering from what we Vets haven't found a word for. His condition is typified by total physical inertia, absence of interest in its ambience - what we Vets call environment - failure to respond to the conventional external stimuli - a ball of string, a nice juicy mouse, a bird. To be blunt, your cat is in a rut. It's the old stockbroker syndrome, the suburban fin de siecle ennui, angst, weltschmertz, call it what you will.

TERRY JONES:
Moping.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
In a way, in a way ... hum ... moping, I must remember that. Now, what's to be done? Tell me sir, have you confused your cat recently?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well we ...

TERRY JONES:
Sh! No.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes ... well I think I can definitely say that your cat badly needs to be confused.

TERRY JONES:
What?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Sh! What?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Confused. To shake it out of its state of complacency. I'm afraid I'm not personally qualified to confuse cats, but I can recommend an extremely good service. Here is their card.

TERRY JONES:
Oooh. 'Confuse-a-Cat Limited'.

MICHAEL PALIN:
'Confuse-a-Cat Limited'.'

TERRY JONES:
Oh.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Squad! Eyes front! Stand at ease. Cat confusers ...shun!

JOHN CLEESE:
Well men, we've got a pretty difficult cat to confuse today so let's get straight on with it. Jolly good. Thank you sergeant.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Confusers attend to the van and fetch out... wait for it... fetch out the funny things.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Move, move, move. One, two, one, two, get those funny things off.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Stage ready for confusing, sir!

JOHN CLEESE:
Very good. Carry on, sergeant.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Left turn, double march!

JOHN CLEESE:
Right men, confuse the ... cat!

JOHN CLEESE:
I hope to God it works. Anyway, we shall know any minute now.

TERRY JONES:
I can't believe it.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Neither can I. It's just like the old days.

TERRY JONES:
Then he's cured. Oh thank you, general.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What can we ever do to repay you?

JOHN CLEESE:
No need to, sir. It's all in a day's work for 'Confuse-a-Cat'.
