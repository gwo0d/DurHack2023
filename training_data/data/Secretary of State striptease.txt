Cut to reverse angle to show that we are no longer in a hospital but in a seedy strip club. The curtains have just swished shut.

ERIC IDLE:
Thank you, thank you. Charles Crompton, the Stripping Doctor. And next, gentlemen and ladies, here at the Peephole Club for the very first time - a very big welcome please for the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Affairs.

TERRY JONES:

soft breathy jazzy music creeps in behind his words and he starts to strip as he talks

DIRECTION:

DIRECTION:

TERRY JONES:

DIRECTION:
He removes the last tassle from his G-string with a flourish. Blackout and curtains quickly close. Compère bounces back on stage.

ERIC IDLE:

DIRECTION:
Burst of Turkish music and curtains swish back as another bowler-hatted pinstriped minister enters doing a Turkish dance.
