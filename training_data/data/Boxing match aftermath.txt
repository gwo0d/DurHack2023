DIRECTION:
Ends with a poster 'Boxing Tonite! The Killer vs. The Champ. 15 Rounds'.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a dressing room at Madison Square Gardens, table, chairs, towels, and the usual paraphernalia. Noise of a crowd outside. The door opens and in comes Mr Gabriello, and two assistants carrying a boxer on a stretcher. Smoke, action, excitement come in with them.

MICHAEL PALIN:
That was a great fight, Champ, a great fight, you hear! Oh boy, what a fight, Champ, what a great fight! You nearly had him, Champ, you nearly had him ... where's his head?

DIRECTION:
I got it in here, Mr Gabriello.

DIRECTION:
He holds up a carrier bag. Gabriello goes over to it, looks inside and shouts into it.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You were great, Champ, d'you hear, you were great!

DIRECTION:
looking in the bag

DIRECTION:
He's got a nasty cut over his eye.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yeah, I think it was a mistake him wearing spectacles.

DIRECTION:
gives the bag to the assistant

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh well, get that sewn onto his body in time for the press pictures.

DIRECTION:
OK, Mr Gabriello.

DIRECTION:
to second assistant

MICHAEL PALIN:
Wasn't he great my boy?

DIRECTION:
Eric

ERIC IDLE:
He was great, Mr Gabriello.

MICHAEL PALIN:
The way he kept fighting after his head came off!

ERIC IDLE:
He was better when the head came off, Mr Gabriello. He was really dodging the guy.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yeah, I reckon that if he could've lasted till the end of that first minute, he would've had the Killer worried.

ERIC IDLE:
Sure, Mr Gabriello.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh he was great. Did you see his left arm?

ERIC IDLE:
No!

MICHAEL PALIN:
OK, we'll look around the hall after everybody's gone.

ERIC IDLE:
Do you realize Mr Gabriello, some of those guys out there paid over $2,000 for a ringside seat.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And where did the head land? Right at the back, that's justice...

DIRECTION:
the door opens; a black cleaner comes in

MICHAEL PALIN:
What d'you want?

DIRECTION:
The cleaner holds up a carrier bag.

TERRY GILLIAM:
This your boy's head?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, no, we've got his head. He ain't hurt that bad.

DIRECTION:
looking in the bag

ERIC IDLE:
Hey, that's Gerry Marinello. He fought the Killer last week.

MICHAEL PALIN:
OK, give it to me. I'm seeing his trainer tomorrow. I'll give it to him.

DIRECTION:
The cleaner is ushered out.

ERIC IDLE:
Hey, Mr Gabriello. The press is still outside. Are you ready for them?

MICHAEL PALIN:
How's the Champ?

DIRECTION:
working away with needle and thread

DIRECTION:
Well, the head's on OK. But there's still a left arm missing.

MICHAEL PALIN:
OK, well keep the dressing gown kinda loose, OK.

DIRECTION:
Gabriello goes to door and opens it

MICHAEL PALIN:
OK boys, come on in!

DIRECTION:
The press surge in. The fighter is propped up.

TERRY JONES:
Hey Mr Gabriello, Mr Gabriello. Did you expect your boy to last the full twenty-eight seconds?

MICHAEL PALIN:
This boy has never let me down. He's the pluckiest goddamn fighter I've ever trained.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Were you worried when his head started to come loose?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, no, we were expecting that. I told them to expect it to and it did. He ain't stupid.

TERRY JONES:
Hey, can we have a word with the Champ?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yeah OK. But keep the questions simple.

TERRY JONES:
Hey Champ! How're you feeling?

DIRECTION:
angrily

MICHAEL PALIN:
I said keep the questions simple!

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Mr Gabriello. People are saying that the kid ought to be buried. His head's come off in the last six fights.

MICHAEL PALIN:
There's no question of burying the kid. He's just reaching the top.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Well, shouldn't he just stay in hospital?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, he ain't going to no hospital. He's got the return fight next week.

DIRECTION:
Shot of the 'New York Times' headline 'Champ to be kept alive for big return'.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a hospital ward. Numerous doctors and nurses are listening to the radio.
