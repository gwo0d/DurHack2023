JOHN CLEESE:
This is the planet Algon, fifth world in the system of Aldebaran, the Red Giant in the constellation of Sagittarius. Here an ordinary cup of drinking chocolate costs four million pounds, an immersion heater for the hot-water tank costs over six billion pounds, and a pair of split-crotch panties would be almost unobtainable.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, our computers have been working all day to analyse the dramatic information that's come in from this first ever intergalactic probe, Algon I ...

MICHAEL PALIN:
But we're now getting some live pictures through from Algon! Harry - Perhaps you could talk us through them.

TERRY JONES:
Very little evidence of shopping facilities here .. there don't seem to be any large supermarkets. There may be some on-the-corner grocery stores behind those rocks, but it's difficult to tell from this angle. It does seem to suggest that most of the shopping here is by direct mail.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Of course the big question that everyone's asking here is, what about those split-crotch parities? Are they going to be unobtainable throughout the Universe or merely on Algon itself? Professor?

ERIC IDLE:
We must remember that Algon is over 75,000 miles wide. The probes come down to this area here and we're really only getting signals from a radius of only thirty or forty miles around the probe. Split-crotch panties, or indeed any items of what we scientists call, 'Sexy Underwear' or 'Erotic Lingerie' may be much more plentiful on other parts of the planet.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Professor, you were responsible for finding Scanty-Panties and Golden Goddess High-Lift Bras on planets which were never thought able to sustain life, and now that man has discovered a new galaxy do you think we're going to see underwear become even naughtier?

ERIC IDLE:
Oh naughtier and naughtier.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well so much for that ... But of course, the probe itself has excited a great deal of interest... for it contains uranium-based dual transmission cells entirely re-charged by solar radiation, which can take off a bra and panties in less than fifteen seconds. It is, of course, the first piece of space hardware to be specially designed to undress ladies, and so there are bound to be some teething troubles ... such as how to cope with the combination of elastic-sided boots and tights.

MICHAEL PALIN:
But I think we're getting some pictures now from Algon itself, and it looks as though ... yes! The satellite has found a bird! The probe has struck crumpet and she looks pretty good too! Professor?

ERIC IDLE:
Ja - she's a real honey!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well the pictures are a bit sporadic... I think probably... the solar radiation during the long journey to Algon...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hoy! Look! Oh dear, I'm sorry we've lost contact. We'll try and re-establish contact with Algon...

ERIC IDLE:
Hello... The BBC have offered me the sum of forty pence to read the credits of this show.

ERIC IDLE:
