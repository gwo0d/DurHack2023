JOHN CLEESE:
This is the planet Algon, fifth world in the system of Aldebaran, the Red Giant in the constellation of Sagittarius. Here an ordinary cup of drinking chocolate costs four million pounds, an immersion heater for the hot-water tank costs over six billion pounds, and a pair of split-crotch panties would be almost unobtainable.

Cut to James M'Burke sitting at a desk. 'Algon I' motifs everywhere. Another expert stands by a model of the planet, and there is a panel of experts at a long desk who are all obviously dummies. Everyone has one of those single earphones.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, our computers have been working all day to analyse the dramatic information that's come in from this first ever intergalactic probe, Algon I ...

DIRECTION:
suddenly very excited as he hears something over his earphone

DIRECTION:
very, indistinct pictures start to come through on the screen behind him

MICHAEL PALIN:
But we're now getting some live pictures through from Algon! Harry - Perhaps you could talk us through them.

DIRECTION:
Cut into pictures from Algon.

DIRECTION:
SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'LIVE FROM ALGON'

DIRECTION:
Very fuzzy pictures of the Algon landscape. Panning and tracking shots hand held.

TERRY JONES:
Very little evidence of shopping facilities here .. there don't seem to be any large supermarkets. There may be some on-the-corner grocery stores behind those rocks, but it's difficult to tell from this angle. It does seem to suggest that most of the shopping here is by direct mail.

SUPERIMPOSED TELEPRINTER CAPTION: 'DIGESTIVE BISCUITS; Â£8,OOO,OOO PER PACKET'

DIRECTION:
Cut to James M'Burke.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Of course the big question that everyone's asking here is, what about those split-crotch parities? Are they going to be unobtainable throughout the Universe or merely on Algon itself? Professor?

DIRECTION:
Cut to a professor sitting beside a contour model of an area of Algon. It has a little model of the probe marking where it has landed.

DIRECTION:
SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'PROFESSOR HERMAN KHAN, DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTE OF SPLIT-CROTCH PANTIES'

ERIC IDLE:
We must remember that Algon is over 75,000 miles wide. The probes come down to this area here and we're really only getting signals from a radius of only thirty or forty miles around the probe. Split-crotch panties, or indeed any items of what we scientists call, 'Sexy Underwear' or 'Erotic Lingerie' may be much more plentiful on other parts of the planet.

DIRECTION:
Camera pans to include M'Burke.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Professor, you were responsible for finding Scanty-Panties and Golden Goddess High-Lift Bras on planets which were never thought able to sustain life, and now that man has discovered a new galaxy do you think we're going to see underwear become even naughtier?

ERIC IDLE:
Oh naughtier and naughtier.

DIRECTION:
SUPERIMPOSED TELEPRINTER CAPTION: 'NO BANANAS ON ALGON'

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well so much for that ... But of course, the probe itself has excited a great deal of interest... for it contains uranium-based dual transmission cells entirely re-charged by solar radiation, which can take off a bra and panties in less than fifteen seconds. It is, of course, the first piece of space hardware to be specially designed to undress ladies, and so there are bound to be some teething troubles ... such as how to cope with the combination of elastic-sided boots and tights.

DIRECTION:
He produces the bottom half of a tailor's dummy wearing boots and tights with panties over the tights halfway down. On the screen behind, more dim indecipherable TV pictures from Algon.

MICHAEL PALIN:
But I think we're getting some pictures now from Algon itself, and it looks as though ... yes! The satellite has found a bird! The probe has struck crumpet and she looks pretty good too! Professor?

ERIC IDLE:
Ja - she's a real honey!

DIRECTION:
All we see on the screen is a blurred female figure.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well the pictures are a bit sporadic... I think probably... the solar radiation during the long journey to Algon...

DIRECTION:
the screen goes blank

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hoy! Look! Oh dear, I'm sorry we've lost contact. We'll try and re-establish contact with Algon...

DIRECTION:
Cut to presenter's-type chair. Mr Badger appears at side of screen.

ERIC IDLE:
Hello... The BBC have offered me the sum of forty pence to read the credits of this show.

DIRECTION:

DIRECTION:
the signature tune is heard

ERIC IDLE:

That's just it. I'd like to say if there are any BBC producers looking in who need people to read the credits for them, I would personally...

DIRECTION:
The camera pulls out to reveal the sixteen-ton weight poised above him. As the picture fades the weight falls on him.
