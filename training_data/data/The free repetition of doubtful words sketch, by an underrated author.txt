DIRECTION:
A post office counter window, with 'Telegram Enquiries' over the top. We see this through an ornate vignette. The clerk is behind the counter. Enter Mr Peepee. They speak very stiltedly.

ERIC IDLE:
I've come for some free repetition of doubtful words on an inland telegram.

TERRY JONES:
Daft, I call it.

ERIC IDLE:
Well it has been a pleasure working with you.

TERRY JONES:
For me also it has been a pleasure. And that concludes our little skit.

DIRECTION:
String quartet music starts to play, as at the beginning, only this time we widen to reveal a string quartet sitting in the set, playing. The clerk and Peepee adopt slightly frozen position. Mix to:
