GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Don't panic, we'll get out of this.

TERRY JONES:
How?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
We'll tunnel our way out.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good thinking, sir. I'll get the horse.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Okay Captain, you detail three men, start digging and load them up with cutlery, and then we'll have a rota, we'll have two hours digging, two hours vaulting and then two hours sleeping, okay?

DIRECTION:
Barnes and others carry a vaulting horse into shot. The members start vaulting over it. Two Gestapo officers walk by.

A door in a building opens and the society members (real people superimposed) run out, along the cartoon, and disappear, falling into nothingness. Cut to section of an oesophagus. The members (now animated cut-outs) fall down it into a stomach where they are joined by various large vegetables. Pull back to show that this is a cutaway view of an Edwardian gentleman. He belches.

TERRY GILLIAM:
Oh, I'm terribly sorry, excuse me.

DIRECTION:
He moves through a door marked 'gents'. We hear a lavatory flushing. Cut to caf√©: linkman at table as before.
