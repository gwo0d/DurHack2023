JOHN CLEESE:
That's not a part of the body.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
No, it's a link though.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I didn't think it was very good.

JOHN CLEESE:
No, it's the end of the series, they must be running out of ideas.

DIRECTION:
Inspector Muffin the Mule bursts through the door.

MICHAEL PALIN:
All right, don't anybody move, there's been a murder.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
A murder?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No... no ... not a murder... no what's like a murder but begins with B?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Birmingham.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No ... no ... no ... no ... no...

JOHN CLEESE:
Burnley?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Burnley - that's right! Burnley in Lancashire. There's been a Burnley.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Burglary.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Burglary. Yes, good man. Burglary - that's it, of course. There's been a burglary.

JOHN CLEESE:
Where?

MICHAEL PALIN:
In the back, just below the rib.

JOHN CLEESE:
No - that's murder.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh... er no... in the band... In the bat... Barclays bat.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Barclays Bank?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes. Nasty business - got away with Â£23,000.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Any clues?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Any what?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Any evidence as to who did it?

DIRECTION:
sarcastically

MICHAEL PALIN:
Any clues, eh? Oh, we don't half talk posh, don't we? I suppose you say 'ehnvelope' and 'larngerie' and 'sarndwiches on the settee'! Well this is a murder investigation, young man, and murder is a very serious business.

JOHN CLEESE:
I thought you said it was a burglary.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Burglary is almost as serious a business as murder. Some burglaries are more serious than murder. A burglary in which someone gets stabbled is murder! So don't come these petty distinctions with me. You're as bad as a judge. Right, now! The first thing to do in the event of a breach of the peace of any kind, is to... go...

DIRECTION:
pause

MICHAEL PALIN:
and ... oh, sorry, sorry, I was miles away.

JOHN CLEESE:
Ring the police?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ring the police. Yes, that's a good idea. Get them over here fast ... no, on second thoughts, get them over here slowly, so they don't drop anything.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Shall I make us all a cup of tea?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Make what you like, Boskovitch - it won't help you in court.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
I

DIRECTION:
beg

CAROL CLEVELAND:
your pardon?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'm sorry, sorry. That's the trouble with being on two cases at once. I keep thinking I've got Boskovitch cornered and in fact I'm investigating a Burnley.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Burglary! Yes - good man.

DIRECTION:
Sound of police siren and sound of cars drawing up outside.

JOHN CLEESE:
Who's Boskovitch?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hah! Boskovitch is a Russian scientist who is passing information to the Russians.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Classified information?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, there he goes again! 'Classified information'! Oh, sitting on the 'settee' with our 'scones' and our 'classified information'!

DIRECTION:
The door opens and a plainclothes detective plus ten PCs (the Fred Tomlinson Singers) enter.
