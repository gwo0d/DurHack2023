ERIC IDLE:
Nigel! Wonderful to see you, super, super, super. Am I a teeny bit late?

TERRY JONES:
A bit, an hour.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, super! Only Snowdon's been re-touching my profile and we can't upset the lovely Snowdon, can we?

TERRY JONES:
Gosh, no.

ERIC IDLE:
It's really lovely to have this little chat with you.

TERRY JONES:
Well, I...

ERIC IDLE:
It is so nice to have this little talk about things. I heard a teeny rumourlette that you were married.

TERRY JONES:
Well, not quite, no. My wife's just died, actually.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh dear.

ERIC IDLE:
Well, perhaps we could do a tribute to her on the show.

TERRY JONES:
Well, no. I...

ERIC IDLE:
I'll get Peter, William, Arthur, Alex, Joan, Ted, Scott, Will, John and Ray to fix it up. It is so nice having this little chat.

TERRY JONES:
Well, actually Timmy, I'm glad to get you on your own...

ERIC IDLE:
You don't mind if Peter just sits in, do you?

TERRY JONES:
Well, actually...

ERIC IDLE:
Only he's doing an article on me for the 'Mail'. He's such a lovely person.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Hello.

ERIC IDLE:
Peter, this is one of the nicest people in the world, Nigel Watt.

ERIC IDLE:
W-A-double T. That's right, yes.

TERRY JONES:
Well, actually, Timmy, the thing is, it's a bit private.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, you don't mind if Peter just sits in, do you? Only Peter's writing a book on me. Peter, you know Tony from the 'Mail', don't you?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, we met in the Turkish bath yesterday.

ERIC IDLE:
Super, super. Did it come up well in the writing yesterday?

JOHN CLEESE:
Great, great, great.

ERIC IDLE:
You took out the tummy references?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, I did.

ERIC IDLE:
Super, super, super. Just to fill you in, this is Nigel Watt and we are having a little heart-to-heart. H-E-A-R-T. Smashing. Do go on, Nigel.

TERRY JONES:
Well, well, the thing is, Timmy, um er...

ERIC IDLE:
Do carry on, it's the 'TV Times', only they syndicate these photographs to America. Would you mind if we just er...

ERIC IDLE:
Super, super. One over here, I think, Bob. A little smile, please, smashing, smashing. Feel free, Bob, to circulate, won't you. Do go on, this is most interesting.

TERRY JONES:
Well, the thing is, Timmy, I'm a bit embarrassed.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, Mr Willimas, it's so nice to see you. Will you sign this for my little daughter, please?

ERIC IDLE:
Hello, Mario. Super, wonderful.

ERIC IDLE:
Just two lovely coffees, please.

ERIC IDLE:
It's German television. Isn't it exciting, Nigel? They're doing a prize-winning documentary on me.

ERIC IDLE:
Thank you. And just two lovely coffees, please.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
Such a lovely waiter. Now, go on please, this is most interesting.

TERRY JONES:
Well ... er... as I was saying, Timmy, my wife's gone... gone.

TERRY JONES:
I've got three children and I'm at my wits end. No job, no insurance, no money at all. I'm absolutely flat broke, I just don't know where to turn. I... I'm absolutely at the end of my tether. You're my only chance. Can you help me, please, Timmy?

ERIC IDLE:
Sorry, I was on the phone to America. It's been super having this lovely little chat. We must do this again more often. Er... will you get the coffees? I'm afraid I must dash, I'm an hour late for the Israeli Embassy.

ERIC IDLE:
Er... did you get that shot all right, sound?

ERIC IDLE:
It... it wasn't a bit too wicked, was it? I mean, it wasn't too cruel?

ERIC IDLE:
No, super... well, er... I think it shows I'm human, don't you?

ERIC IDLE:
Super, super. Well, the charabanc's here. Go on, everybody. Bye.

JOHN CLEESE:
Timmy Williams' 'Coffee Time' was brought to you live from Woppi's in Holborn.
