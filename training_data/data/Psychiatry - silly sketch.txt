CAROL CLEVELAND:
Dr Larch ... there's a Mr Phelps to see you.

JOHN CLEESE:
Er, nurse!

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Yes?

DIRECTION:
whispering

JOHN CLEESE:
Er, you don't think you should make it clear that I'm a psychiatrist?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
What?

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, I could be any type of doctor.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Well I can't come in and say 'Psychiatrist Larch' or 'Dr Larch who is a psychiatrist'. Oh, anyway look, it's written on the door.

DIRECTION:
still whispering

JOHN CLEESE:
That's outside.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Well, I don't care, you'll just have to do it yourself.

DIRECTION:
she leaves

DIRECTION:
goes 'brr brr', then picks up phone

DIRECTION:
knock at the door

JOHN CLEESE:
Er, come in.

DIRECTION:
Phelps comes in dressed as Napoleon, with a parrot on his head, and a leash with nothing on it.

TERRY JONES:
Bow, wow, wow.

JOHN CLEESE:
Ah Mr Phelps. Come on in, take a seat. Now what seems to be the matter?

TERRY JONES:
No, no, no. No. No.

JOHN CLEESE:
I'm sorry?

TERRY JONES:
Oh can't you do better than that? I mean it's so predictable I've seen it a million times. Knock, knock, knock come in, ah Mr Phelps take a seat. I've seen it and seen it.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well look will you please sit down and do your first line.

TERRY JONES:
No. No. I've had enough. I've had enough.

DIRECTION:
he exits

JOHN CLEESE:
I can't even get it started.

DIRECTION:
off

TERRY JONES:
Albatross!

JOHN CLEESE:
Shut up! Oh it drives me mad.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a man in limbo: Mr Notlob.

MICHAEL PALIN:
A mad psychiatrist, that'd be new.

DIRECTION:
Cut back to the psychiatrist.

JOHN CLEESE:
Next please.

DIRECTION:
Knocking at door. Psychiatrist is about to call when he picks up a thesaurus and thumbs through it.

JOHN CLEESE:
Cross the threshold, arrive, ingress, gain admittance, infiltrate.

DIRECTION:
Notlob enters in an ordinary suit

JOHN CLEESE:
Ah Mr Notlob, ah park your hips, on the sitting device.

DIRECTION:
to camera

MICHAEL PALIN:
It is a mad psychiatrist.

JOHN CLEESE:
I'm not. I'm not. Come on in. Take a seat. What's, what's the matter?

DIRECTION:
Cut to Napoleon in limbo; he blows a raspberry.

JOHN CLEESE:
Now what's the matter?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well I keep hearing guitars playing and people singing when there's no one around.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, well this is not at all uncommon. In certain mental states we find that auditory hallucinations occur which are of a most ...

DIRECTION:
he steps suddenly and listens; the sound of 'We're all going to the zoo tomorrow' is heard

JOHN CLEESE:
Is that 'We're all going to the zoo tomorrow'?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes. Yes.

JOHN CLEESE:
Is it always that?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well that's something.

MICHAEL PALIN:
But it's mainly folk songs.

DIRECTION:
concerned

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh my God.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Last night I had 'I'll never fall in love again' for six hours.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well look, I think I'd better have a second opinion on this. I want you to see a colleague of mine, a specialist in these sort of things, who has an office very much like this one as a matter of fact.
