GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I

DIRECTION:
am

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
asking.

JOHN CLEESE:
Good for you. My word yes. Well Chris, what is it that it is - this theory of mine. Well, this is what it is - my theory that I have, that is to say, which is mine, is mine.

beginning to show signs of exasperation

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, I know it's yours, what is it?

JOHN CLEESE:
Where? Oh, what is my theory? This is it.

DIRECTION:
clears throat at some length

DIRECTION:
clears throat at great length

JOHN CLEESE:
This is how it goes. The next thing I'm going to say is my theory. Ready?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes!

JOHN CLEESE:
My Theory by A. Elk. Brackets Miss, brackets. This theory goes as follows and begins now. All brontosauruses are thin at one end, much much thicker in the middle, and then thin again at the far end. That is my theory, it is mine, and belongs to me and I own it, and what it is too.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
That's

DIRECTION:
it

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
, is it?

JOHN CLEESE:
Spot on, Chris.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, er, this theory of yours seems to have hit the nail on the head.

JOHN CLEESE:
And it's mine.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, thank you for coming along to the studio. Thank you.

JOHN CLEESE:
My pleasure, Chris...

JOHN CLEESE:
And whose it is.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, thank you - that's all - thank you. ...opens next week.

JOHN CLEESE:
I have another theory.

JOHN CLEESE:

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Thank you. Britain's newest wasp farm...

JOHN CLEESE:
This second theory which was the one that I had said...

DIRECTION:
the phone rings; he answers

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, no I'm trying...

JOHN CLEESE:
Which I could expound without doubt. This second theory which, with the one which I have said, forms the brace of theories which I own and which belongs to me, goes like this...

DIRECTION:
looking at  his shoe

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
nine and a half, wide fitting...Balleys of Bond Street. What? No, sort of brogue.

JOHN CLEESE:
This is what it is.

DIRECTION:
clears throat

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Eight and a half.

JOHN CLEESE:
This is it...

DIRECTION:
lots of noisy throat clearing

DIRECTION:
He rises and leaves the set to go next door to the travel agent set, leaving Miss Elk behind for a moment. Bounder is still on the phone. His other phone rings; he answers it.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hello, yes,,,yes,,,

DIRECTION:
The presenter enters the travel set. The tourist is still droning on as before and Bounder is still on the phone.

DIRECTION:
carrying on all through the scene below

ERIC IDLE:
...and the Spanish Tourist Board promises you that the raging cholera epidemic is merely a case of mild Spanish tummy, like the last outbreak of Spanish tummy in 1660 which killed half London and decimated Europe, and meanwhile the bloody Guardia are busy arresting sixteen-year-olds for kissing in the streets and shooting anyone under nineteen who doesn't like Franco...

DIRECTION:
The presenter approaches Bounder.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
The fire brigade are here. They're coming.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hello! No, no, no I think they are all part of the British Shoe Corporation now.

DIRECTION:
Miss Elk follows the presenter in.

JOHN CLEESE:
Chris, this other theory of mine which is mine like the other one I also own. The second theory...

DIRECTION:
The fire brigade enter and the secretary goes to greet them. They speak to her and she takes off her shoe to check the size. Meanwhile...

JOHN CLEESE:
My second theory states that fire brigade choirs seldom sing songs about Marcel Proust.

DIRECTION:
With only a half-beat pause the fire brigade start singing the Proust song. After the usual number of lines we hear the gong.

ERIC IDLE:
Start again.

DIRECTION:
The loony looks into the scene on overlay and waves at the camera just as we fade to black. We hold black for a few seconds and then the loony leans in to the black and waves again before fading away.
