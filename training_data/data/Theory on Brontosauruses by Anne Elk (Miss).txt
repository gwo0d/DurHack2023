GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Good evening.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I have with me tonight Anne Elk. Mrs Anne Elk.

JOHN CLEESE:
Miss.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You have a new theory about the brontosaurus.

JOHN CLEESE:
Can I just say here Chris for one moment that I have a new theory about the brontosaurus.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Exactly.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What is it?

JOHN CLEESE:
Where?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no your new theory?

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, what is my theory?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh what is my theory that it is. Yes, well you may well ask me what is my theory.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
asking.

JOHN CLEESE:
Good for you. My word yes. Well Chris, what is it that it is - this theory of mine. Well, this is what it is - my theory that I have, that is to say, which is mine, is mine.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, I know it's yours, what is it?

JOHN CLEESE:
Where? Oh, what is my theory? This is it.

JOHN CLEESE:
This is how it goes. The next thing I'm going to say is my theory. Ready?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes!

JOHN CLEESE:
My Theory by A. Elk. Brackets Miss, brackets. This theory goes as follows and begins now. All brontosauruses are thin at one end, much much thicker in the middle, and then thin again at the far end. That is my theory, it is mine, and belongs to me and I own it, and what it is too.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
That's

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
, is it?

JOHN CLEESE:
Spot on, Chris.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, er, this theory of yours seems to have hit the nail on the head.

JOHN CLEESE:
And it's mine.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, thank you for coming along to the studio. Thank you.

JOHN CLEESE:
My pleasure, Chris...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Next week Britain's newest wasp farm...

JOHN CLEESE:
It's been a lot of fun.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, thank you very much.

JOHN CLEESE:
Saying what my theory is.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, thank you.

JOHN CLEESE:
And whose it is.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, thank you - that's all - thank you. ...opens next week.

JOHN CLEESE:
I have another theory.

JOHN CLEESE:
Called my second theory, or my theory number two.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Thank you. Britain's newest wasp farm...

JOHN CLEESE:
This second theory which was the one that I had said...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, no I'm trying...

JOHN CLEESE:
Which I could expound without doubt. This second theory which, with the one which I have said, forms the brace of theories which I own and which belongs to me, goes like this...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
nine and a half, wide fitting...Balleys of Bond Street. What? No, sort of brogue.

JOHN CLEESE:
This is what it is.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Eight and a half.

JOHN CLEESE:
This is it...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hello, yes,,,yes,,,

ERIC IDLE:
...and the Spanish Tourist Board promises you that the raging cholera epidemic is merely a case of mild Spanish tummy, like the last outbreak of Spanish tummy in 1660 which killed half London and decimated Europe, and meanwhile the bloody Guardia are busy arresting sixteen-year-olds for kissing in the streets and shooting anyone under nineteen who doesn't like Franco...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
The fire brigade are here. They're coming.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hello! No, no, no I think they are all part of the British Shoe Corporation now.

JOHN CLEESE:
Chris, this other theory of mine which is mine like the other one I also own. The second theory...

JOHN CLEESE:
My second theory states that fire brigade choirs seldom sing songs about Marcel Proust.

ERIC IDLE:
Start again.
