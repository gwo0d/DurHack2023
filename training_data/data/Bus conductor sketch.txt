Cut to a bus set. There is a very bad backcloth of the interior of the top deck of a bus. It looks like the set for a rather tatty revue. On the cut Mr Man is standing in exactly the same place as he was - so that it looks as if the scene has changed around him. The RSM appears from one side. He is still dressed basically as an RSM but has a few bus conductor things such as a ticket machine, money satchel and a big arrow through his neck. He talks like a music-hall comedian.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Any more fares please? I've got a chauffeur and every time I go to the lavatory he drives me potty! Boom-boom! One in a row

DIRECTION:

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:

DIRECTION:

brief film clip of audience laughing

ERIC IDLE:

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I am looking - it's the only way I keep my eyelids apart! Boom-boom! Every one a Maserati!

ERIC IDLE:
Look! You said I was going to be a funny passenger.

DIRECTION:
snapping out of music-hall manner

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What do you mean?

ERIC IDLE:
I mean, all I said was, fivepenny please, You can't call that a funny line.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well it's the way you said it.

ERIC IDLE:
No it isn't. Nobody can say 'fivepenny please' and make it funny.
