JOHN CLEESE:
Sorry about that, darling...

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Gravy?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes please, dear.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh dear, that'll be the Cheap-Laughs from next door.

JOHN CLEESE:
Come in.

TERRY JONES:
No! Just breathing heavily!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh we just dropped in.

JOHN CLEESE:
Would you like to come through...

TERRY JONES:
Well goodnight and give us a kiss.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh thank you very much for a very nice evening.

TERRY JONES:
After you, dear.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh honestly dear, why do we always have to buy everything just because the Cheap-Laughs have one?

ERIC IDLE:
This is not an interruption at all.

JOHN CLEESE:
It's just neighbourliness dear, that's all...

CAROL CLEVELAND:
I think we should try and lead our own lives from now on.

JOHN CLEESE:
Can't you be serious for one moment?

JOHN CLEESE:
I'm sorry I was cross earlier.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh that's all right, dear. It's just that I get so sick of always having to be like the Cheap-Laughs.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well yes, from now on we'll be like ourselves.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh Roger...

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh Beatrice.
