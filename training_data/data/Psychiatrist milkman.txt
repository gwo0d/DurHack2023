ERIC IDLE:
Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake baker's man. Good morning, madam, I'm a psychiatrist.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You look like a milkman to me.

ERIC IDLE:
Good.

ERIC IDLE:
as a milkman... you spotted that - well done.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Go away.

ERIC IDLE:
Now then, madam. I'm going to show you three numbers, and I want you to tell me if you see any similarity between them.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
They're all number three.

ERIC IDLE:
No. Try again.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
They're

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
number three?

ERIC IDLE:
No. They're

ERIC IDLE:
Right. Now. I'm going to say a word, and I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head. How many pints do you want?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Er, three?

ERIC IDLE:
Yogurt?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Er... no.

ERIC IDLE:
Cream?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No.

ERIC IDLE:
Eggs?

ERIC IDLE:
Right. Well, you're quite clearly suffering from a repressive libido complex, probably the product of an unhappy childhood, coupled with acute insecurity in adolescence, which has resulted in an attenuation of the libido complex.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
a bloody milkman.

ERIC IDLE:
Don't you shout at me, madam, don't come that tone. Now then, I must ask you to accompany me down to the dairy and do some aptitude tests.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I've got better things to do than come down to the dairy!

ERIC IDLE:
Mrs Ratbag, if you don't mind me saying so, you are badly in need of an expensive course of psychiatric treatment. Now I'm not going to say a trip to our dairy will cure you, but it will give hundreds of lower-paid workers a good laugh.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
All right... but how am I going to get home?

ERIC IDLE:
I'll run you there and back on my psychiatrist's float.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
All right.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What are those?

ERIC IDLE:
They're case histories.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, sir?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah, good morning. I'm afraid our regular psychiatrist hasn't come round this morning ... and I've got an ego block which is in turn making my wife over-assertive and getting us both into a state of depressive neurosis.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, I see, sir. Who's your regular, sir?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Jersey Cream Psychiatrists.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh yes, I know them.

ERIC IDLE:
Right, well, er, what's your job, then?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'm a doctor.

ERIC IDLE:
... Didn't I see you just now under a Scotsman?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, but I

MICHAEL PALIN:
a doctor. Actually, I'm a gynaecologist but that was my lunchhour.

ERIC IDLE:
remind you of?.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Two pints of cream.

ERIC IDLE:
Right... well I should definitely say you're suffering from a severe personality disorder, sir, sublimating itself in a lactic obsession which could get worse depending on how much money you've got.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, yes, I see. And a pot of yogurt, please.
