All right, I'll go.

DIRECTION:
She turns it off. The TV set just folds up as if empty and collapses on to the floor. Dust rises. She goes into the hallway to the front door (singing 'Anything Goes' by the other Cole Porter to herself) and opens it. A man with a briefcase stands there.

ERIC IDLE:
Hello, madam...

DIRECTION:

TERRY JONES:
Ah hello... you must have come about...

Oh, nice place you've got here.

Finish sentences... yes.

TERRY JONES:

ERIC IDLE:
Husband?

TERRY JONES:
Yes. He...

ERIC IDLE:
Never lets you finish what you've started.

TERRY JONES:
Quite. I'm beginning to feel...

ERIC IDLE:
That you'll never finish a sentence again as long as you live.

TERRY JONES:
Exact...

ERIC IDLE:
ly. It must be awful.

TERRY JONES:
It's driving me...

ERIC IDLE:
To drink?

ERIC IDLE:
You see, our method is to reassure the patient by recreating normal... er...

TERRY JONES:
Conditions?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes. Then we try to get them in a position where they suddenly find that they're completing other people's sentences...

Themselves!

Thank you very much for coming along.

TERRY JONES:
Not at all

ERIC IDLE:
And good...

TERRY JONES:
Bye, Mr...

ERIC IDLE:
Vernon.

DIRECTION:
Mrs Long Name leaves. Mr Vernon shuts the door. A girl's voice comes from sitting room.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Carl?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, dear?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
I've just had another baby.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, no! How many's that now?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Twelve since lunch... Oh! There's another one!

DIRECTION:
Cut to exterior of Mrs Long Name's house. She comes out and sets off purposefully up the road, passing four pepperpot nannies digging up the road. They are wearing the usual slippers, paisley dresses and knotted handkerchief. One wears a helmet. One works a pneumatic drill. She is stripped to the waist wearing a big pink bra. Behind, heroic shots of Mrs Long Name walking out of town, through suburbs, into neat country, then into wilder country. She finally stops in close up, and looks up with inspiration in her eyes.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a linkman standing before Stonehenge.
