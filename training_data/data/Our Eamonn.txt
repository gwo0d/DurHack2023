DIRECTION:
As she puts the phone down the front door beside her opens and there stands a huge African warrior in war paint and with a spear and shield. At his feet are several smart suitcases.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Mummy!

TERRY JONES:
Eamonn.

DIRECTION:
he brings in the cases and closes the front door

TERRY JONES:
Mervyn! Look it's our Eamonn - oh let me look at you, tell me how... how is it in Dublin?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, things is pretty bad there at the moment but there does seem some hope of a constitutional settlement.

TERRY JONES:
Oh don't talk. Let me just look at you.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Great to be home, mummy. How are you?

TERRY JONES:
Oh, I'm fine. I must just go upstairs and get your room ready.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It's a bungalow, mummy.

TERRY JONES:
Oh damn, yes. Mervyn, Mervyn - look who's here, it's our Eamonn come back to see us.

DIRECTION:
Mervyn appears. He still looks shattered by the death of the hamster.

JOHN CLEESE:
Hello, Eamonn.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Hello, Merv.

JOHN CLEESE:
How was Dublin?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well as I was telling mummy here, things is pretty bad there at the moment but there does seem some hope of a constitutional settlement.

DIRECTION:
The phone rings.

DIRECTION:
answering phone

DIRECTION:
looking at Eamonn's bare foot

JOHN CLEESE:
Size seven. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes .... it's the fire brigade, they want to know if they can come round Thursday evening.

TERRY JONES:

DIRECTION:
into the phone

DIRECTION:
fade out

DIRECTION:
Fade up on a dinner-jacketed announcer sitting at a table with a bowl of flowers on it. A hand waves from inside the bowl of flowers.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And so it was the fire brigade eventually came round on Friday night.

DIRECTION:
Cut to fire engines skidding out of the fire station and roaring away - speeded up. They skid to a halt outside the Littles' suburban house. Firemen pour out of the fire engine and start to swarm in through the windows. Cut to interior of Littles' sitting room. It is laid out for a cocktail party. Mervyn is in evening dress and is sitting on the sofa looking very depressed. Mrs Little in a faded cocktail dress. Eamonn still in warpaint with spear and shield. The firemen appear.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, so glad you could come. What would you like to drink? Gin and tonic? Sherry?

DIRECTION:
in unison

DIRECTION:
as she starts to pour drinks the firemen confide in unison

DIRECTION:
We do like being called out to these little parties, they're much better than fires.

DIRECTION:
The phone rings. Half the firemen go to answer it.

DIRECTION:
off

DIRECTION:
Yes, yes yes.

DIRECTION:
Well, how was Dublin, Eamonn?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, as I was telling mummy and Mervyn earlier, things is pretty bad there at the moment but there does seem some hope of a constitutional...

DIRECTION:
to camera

DIRECTION:
shot of party in the hall; we can just see the fireman on phone; they keep looking at their shoe sizes

TERRY JONES:
You know I used to dread parties until I watched 'Party Hints by Veronica'. I think it's on now...
