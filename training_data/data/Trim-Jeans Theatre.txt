Good evening. This new series of 'Trim-Jeans Theatre Presents' will enable you to enjoy the poetry of T. S. Eliot whilst losing unsightly tummy bulge. Jean.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Wow, yes and the inches stay off. Mark.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Terrific! Thrill to Thomas a Becket's Kierkegaardian moment of choice while making your physique tighter, firmer, neater.

I am here. No traitor to the King.

ERIC IDLE:
Absolve all those you have excommunicated.

A terrific product.

ERIC IDLE:
And this comes complete with the most revolutionary guarantee in slenderizing history!

MICHAEL PALIN:
This was Kevin Francis before last season's 'Trim-Jean Play of the Month' production of 'The Seagull' by Anton Chekhov and the Sauna Belt Trim-Jean Company Limited. See Kevin has slipped into his slenderizing garment and is inflating it with the handy little pump provided. Three acts and a few special torso exercises later, Kevin, as Trigorin, the failed writer of sentimental romances, has lost over thirty-three inches.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Wow. What a difference. That Anton Chekhov can certainly write.

ERIC IDLE:
Terrific.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Terrific.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, why not join us for a season of classic plays and rapid slenderizing. Enjoy Sir John Gielgud and Sir Ralph Richardson losing a total of fifteen inches in David Storey's 'Home'.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Enjoy the 'The Trim Gentlemen of Verona' and 'Long Day's Journey into Night' while inches melt away.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Enjoy Glenda Jackson with a Constant Snug Fit and Solid Support in all four areas.

ERIC IDLE:
Other productions will include... 'Treasure Island' ...

and the Trim-Jeans version of 'The Great Escape', with a cast of thousands losing well over fifteen hundred inches.
