MICHAEL PALIN:
I would like to meet someone of superior intelligence.

TERRY JONES:
I would like to hear the sound of two bricks being bashed together.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I would like to see John the Babtist's impersonation of Graham Hill.

DIRECTION:
Cut to historical impersonation sketch. Big zoom in to linkman. Glittery linkman set, showbizzy music and applause.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, it's Historical Impersonations. When you in the present can make those in the past stars of the future. And here is your host for tonight - Wally Wiggin.

DIRECTION:
CAPTION: 'HISTORICAL IMPERSONATIONS'

DIRECTION:
Fade applause and music.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hello, good evening and welcome to Historical Impersonations. And we kick off tonight with Cardinal Richelieu and his impersonation of Petula Clark.

DIRECTION:
Cut to Cardinal Richelieu, he mimes to the phrase from the record.

MICHAEL PALIN:
'Don't sleep in the subway darling and don't stand in the pouring rain'.

DIRECTION:
Vast applause.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Cardinal Richelieu - sixteen stone of pure man. And now your favourite Roman Emperor Julius Caesar as Eddie Waring.

DIRECTION:
Cut to Caesar; cloud effects behind.

DIRECTION:
in Waring voice

ERIC IDLE:
Tota gallia divisa est in tres partes Wigan, Hunslett and Hull Kingston Rovers.

DIRECTION:
Cut back to Wiggin.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well done indeed, Julius Caesar, a smile, a conquest and a dagger up your strap. Our next challenger comes all the way from the Crimea. It's the very lovely Florence Nightingale as Brian London.

DIRECTION:
Florence Nightingale (Graham) stands there with a lamp, simpering femininely. A boxing bell goes, slight pause, then she is hit on the side of the cheek with a boxing glove, and fallls straight on her back.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And now for our most ambitious attempt tonight - all the way from Moscow in the USS of R - Ivan the Terrible as a sales assistant in Freeman, Hardy and Willis.

DIRECTION:
In a shoe department. Three people are sitting in chain, only the middle one is a dummy. Ivan the Terrible comes in and splits the man in the middle in half with an immense two-handed sword: the model splits in two.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And now W. G. Grace as a music box.

DIRECTION:
ANIMATION: Still picture of W. G. Grace. Slowly his head starts to revolve as a musical box plays Swiss-type music.

DIRECTION:
Cut back to Wiggin.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And now it's France's turn. One of their top statesmen, Napoleon as the R101 disaster.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a sky backgrouned Napoleon comes into frame horizontally, moving along a wire very slowly. In each hand he has a small propeller. A sign hangs below his belly saying R101. Marseillaise plays. As he passes out of shot there is an explosion.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And now it's request time.

DIRECTION:
Cut to Gumby.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I would like to see John the Baptist's impersonation of Graham Hill.

DIRECTION:
A head on a platter is pulled by a string across the floor. We hear brm, brm, brm, noises. The head of John the Baptist has a Graham Hill moustache, obviously stuck on.

DIRECTION:
Women's Institute applaud.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And now a short intermission during which Marcel Marceau will impersonate a man walking against the wind.

DIRECTION:
Marcel Marceau (Graham) walks against the wind.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And now Marcel will mime a man being struck about the head by a sixteen-ton weight.

DIRECTION:
Cut to him starting the mime. He doesn't get very far as a sixteen-ton weight is dropped on his head.

DIRECTION:
Cut to Wembley crowd cheering.
