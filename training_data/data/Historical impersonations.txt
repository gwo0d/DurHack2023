MICHAEL PALIN:
I would like to meet someone of superior intelligence.

TERRY JONES:
I would like to hear the sound of two bricks being bashed together.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I would like to see John the Babtist's impersonation of Graham Hill.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, it's Historical Impersonations. When you in the present can make those in the past stars of the future. And here is your host for tonight - Wally Wiggin.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hello, good evening and welcome to Historical Impersonations. And we kick off tonight with Cardinal Richelieu and his impersonation of Petula Clark.

MICHAEL PALIN:
'Don't sleep in the subway darling and don't stand in the pouring rain'.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Cardinal Richelieu - sixteen stone of pure man. And now your favourite Roman Emperor Julius Caesar as Eddie Waring.

ERIC IDLE:
Tota gallia divisa est in tres partes Wigan, Hunslett and Hull Kingston Rovers.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well done indeed, Julius Caesar, a smile, a conquest and a dagger up your strap. Our next challenger comes all the way from the Crimea. It's the very lovely Florence Nightingale as Brian London.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And now for our most ambitious attempt tonight - all the way from Moscow in the USS of R - Ivan the Terrible as a sales assistant in Freeman, Hardy and Willis.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And now W. G. Grace as a music box.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And now it's France's turn. One of their top statesmen, Napoleon as the R101 disaster.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And now it's request time.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I would like to see John the Baptist's impersonation of Graham Hill.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And now a short intermission during which Marcel Marceau will impersonate a man walking against the wind.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And now Marcel will mime a man being struck about the head by a sixteen-ton weight.
