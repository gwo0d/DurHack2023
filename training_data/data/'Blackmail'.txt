MICHAEL PALIN:
Hello, good evening, and welcome to 'Blackmail'! And to start tonight's programme, we go to Preston in Lancashire, and Mrs Betty Teal!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hello, Mrs Teal!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Now this is for £15 and it's to stop us revealing the name of your lover in Bolton.

MICHAEL PALIN:
So Mrs Teal...if you send us £15 by return post, please, and your husband Trevor, and your lovely children, Diane, Janice and Juliet need never know the name of your lover in Bolton.

MICHAEL PALIN:
...to stop us from revealing your name, the name of the three other people involved, the youth organization to which they belong, and the shop where you bought the equipment.

MICHAEL PALIN:
We'll be showing you more of that photograph later in the programme...unless we hear from Charles or Michael. And now it's time for our 'Stop the Film' spot!

MICHAEL PALIN:
The rules are very simple. We have taken a film which contains compromising scenes and unpleasant details, which could wreck a man's career. But, the victim may phone me at any point and stop the film. But remember the money increases as the film goes on. So the longer you leave it...the more you have to pay! So now, with the clock at £300 this week 'Stop the Film' visited Thames Ditton...

MICHAEL PALIN:
He's being very brave here...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hello, sir, hello, yes. No sir, no, I'm sure you didn't. No, it's all right, sir, we don't morally censure, we just want the money....Yes, and here's the address to send it to:

MICHAEL PALIN:
Not at all, sir...thank
