MICHAEL PALIN:
The lone piper on the battlements of Edinburgh Castle...

TERRY JONES:
Next!

MICHAEL PALIN:
So successful has been the training of the Kamikaze Regiment that the numbers have dwindled from 30,000 to just over a dozen in three weeks. What makes these young Scotsmen so keen to kill themselves?

MICHAEL PALIN:
The money's good!

ERIC IDLE:
And the water skiing!

TERRY JONES:
Ten-shun.

JOHN CLEESE:
All right, sergeant major. At ease. Now, how many chaps have you got left?

TERRY JONES:
Six, sir,

JOHN CLEESE:
Six?

TERRY JONES:
Five, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
Jolly good show, sergeant major.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, I've come to tell you that we've got a job for your five lads.

TERRY JONES:
Four, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
For your four lads.

TERRY JONES:
Good luck, Taggart.

JOHN CLEESE:
Now, which ... er ... which four are they?

TERRY JONES:
These three here, sir. OK. Off you go, Smith.

JOHN CLEESE:
... er ... sergeant major!

TERRY JONES:
Yes, sir?

JOHN CLEESE:
You don't think it might be a good idea... er... to stop the training programme for a little bit?

TERRY JONES:
They got to be trained, sir. It's a dangerous job.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes ... I know... but... er ...

TERRY JONES:
All right MacPherson, you're next, off you go.

JOHN CLEESE:
You see what is worrying me, sergeant major, is...

TERRY JONES:
Good luck, MacPherson.

JOHN CLEESE:
Er... MacPherson...

TERRY JONES:
Both of who, sir?

JOHN CLEESE:
Sergeant major, what's this man's name?

TERRY JONES:
This one sir? This one is MacDonald, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
No, no, no, no.

JOHN CLEESE:
Hang on to MacDonald, sergeant major, hang on to him.

TERRY JONES:
I don't know whether I can, sir...

TERRY JONES:
he's in a state of Itsubishi Kyoko McSayonara.

JOHN CLEESE:
What's that?

TERRY JONES:
It's the fifth state that a Scotsman can achieve, sir. He's got to finish himself off by lunchtime or he thinks he's let down the Emperor, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, can't we get him out of it?

TERRY JONES:
Oh, I dunno how to, sir. Our Kamikaze instructor, Mr Yashimoto, was so good he never left Tokyo airport.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, there must be someone else who can advise us?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good morning, Kamikaze, please.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Thank you.
