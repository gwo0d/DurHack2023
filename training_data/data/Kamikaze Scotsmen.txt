MICHAEL PALIN:
The lone piper on the battlements of Edinburgh Castle...

DIRECTION:
There are a few bars of bagpipe music. Suddenly there is a scream and he disappears. Cut to interior of stone-walled guardroom inside Edinburgh Castle. Ten kilted Scottish guardsmen with bagpipes in a line. A sergeant major at the door taps one on the shoulder.

TERRY JONES:
Next!

DIRECTION:
The next goes outside. We hear pipes start, the sergeant smiles. Cut to castle battlements. The piper plays and then jumps off. We hear the scream as before. Another piper emerges and goes through the same routine.

DIRECTION:
Scottish accent

DIRECTION:
there is a scream and a piper jumps off, another one emerges and starts to play

MICHAEL PALIN:
So successful has been the training of the Kamikaze Regiment that the numbers have dwindled from 30,000 to just over a dozen in three weeks. What makes these young Scotsmen so keen to kill themselves?

DIRECTION:
Close ups of soldiers.

MICHAEL PALIN:
The money's good!

ERIC IDLE:
And the water skiing!

DIRECTION:
he falls down with a scream

DIRECTION:
Cut to interior of the guardroom in Edinburgh Castle. As before, but with only six men left plus the sergeant major. Bagpipes and a scream. The sergeant major dispatches another man. A captain enters. Bagpipes again.

TERRY JONES:
Ten-shun.

JOHN CLEESE:
All right, sergeant major. At ease. Now, how many chaps have you got left?

TERRY JONES:
Six, sir,

JOHN CLEESE:
Six?

DIRECTION:
there is a scream

TERRY JONES:
Five, sir.

DIRECTION:
to another highlander carrying bagpipes

DIRECTION:
Johnson leaves

JOHN CLEESE:
Jolly good show, sergeant major.

DIRECTION:
we hear bagpipes starting up outside

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, I've come to tell you that we've got a job for your five lads.

DIRECTION:
There is a scream.

TERRY JONES:
Four, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
For your four lads.

DIRECTION:
whispering to another man

TERRY JONES:
Good luck, Taggart.

DIRECTION:
Thank you, sarge.

DIRECTION:
he goes

DIRECTION:
looking rather uncertainly at the man leaving

DIRECTION:
bagpipes start

DIRECTION:
the usual scream in the background

JOHN CLEESE:
Now, which ... er ... which four are they?

TERRY JONES:
These three here, sir. OK. Off you go, Smith.

DIRECTION:
with manic eagerness

DIRECTION:
he charges out through door before captain can stop him

DIRECTION:
with mounting concern

JOHN CLEESE:
... er ... sergeant major!

TERRY JONES:
Yes, sir?

DIRECTION:
bagpipes start outside

JOHN CLEESE:
You don't think it might be a good idea... er... to stop the training programme for a little bit?

TERRY JONES:
They got to be trained, sir. It's a dangerous job.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes ... I know... but... er ...

DIRECTION:
the usual scream

TERRY JONES:
All right MacPherson, you're next, off you go.

JOHN CLEESE:
You see what is worrying me, sergeant major, is...

DIRECTION:
I'll make it a gud'un, sir!

DIRECTION:
he dashes off

TERRY JONES:
Good luck, MacPherson.

JOHN CLEESE:
Er... MacPherson...

DIRECTION:
the bagpipes start up

DIRECTION:
scream

TERRY JONES:
Both of who, sir?

JOHN CLEESE:
Sergeant major, what's this man's name?

TERRY JONES:
This one sir? This one is MacDonald, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
No, no, no, no.

DIRECTION:
the captain stops MacDonald who is straining quite hard to get away

JOHN CLEESE:
Hang on to MacDonald, sergeant major, hang on to him.

TERRY JONES:
I don't know whether I can, sir...

DIRECTION:
MacDonald's eyes are staring in a strange way

TERRY JONES:
he's in a state of Itsubishi Kyoko McSayonara.

JOHN CLEESE:
What's that?

DIRECTION:
They am both struggling to restrain MacDonald.

TERRY JONES:
It's the fifth state that a Scotsman can achieve, sir. He's got to finish himself off by lunchtime or he thinks he's let down the Emperor, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, can't we get him out of it?

TERRY JONES:
Oh, I dunno how to, sir. Our Kamikaze instructor, Mr Yashimoto, was so good he never left Tokyo airport.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, there must be someone else who can advise us?

DIRECTION:
Exterior of smart London health-salon-type frontage. A big sign reads 'Kamikaze Advice Centre'. A bowler-hatted man enters. A receptionist sits behind a posh desk.

DIRECTION:
very businesslike

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good morning, Kamikaze, please.

DIRECTION:
indicating door

DIRECTION:
Yes, would you go through, please?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Thank you.

DIRECTION:
The man walks over to the door, opens it, walks through and disappears from sight. There is nothing but sky and clouds through the door.

DIRECTION:
Scream.

DIRECTION:
Cut back to castle guardroom.
