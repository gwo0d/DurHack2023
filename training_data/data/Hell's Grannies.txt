ERIC IDLE:
This is a frightened city. Over these houses, over these streets hangs a pall of fear. Fear of a new kind of violence which is terrorizing the city. Yes, gangs of old ladies attacking defenseless, fit young men.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well they come up to you, like, and push you - shove you off the pavement, like. There's usually four or five of them.

TERRY JONES:
Yeah, this used to be a nice neighbourhood before the old ladies started moving in. Nowadays some of us daren't even go down to the shops.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well Mr Johnson's son Kevin, he don't go out any more. He comes back from wrestling and locks himself in his room.

ERIC IDLE:
What are they in it for, these old hoodlums, these layabouts in lace?

ERIC IDLE:
Favourite targets for the old ladies are telephone kiosks.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
We have a lot of trouble with these oldies. Pension day's the worst - they go mad. As soon as they get their hands on their money they blow it all on milk, bread, tea, tin of meat for the cat.

TERRY JONES:
Yes, well of course they come here for the two o'clock matinee, all the old bags out in there, especially if it's something like 'The Sound of Music'. We get seats ripped up, hearing aids broken, all that sort of thing.

ERIC IDLE:
The whole problem of these senile delinquents lies in their complete rejection of the values of contemporary society. They've seen their children grow up and become accountants, stockbrokers and even sociologists, and they begin to wonder if it is all really...

ERIC IDLE:
arggh!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh well we sometimes feel we're to blame in some way for what our gran's become. I mean she used to be happy here until she, she started on the crochet.

ERIC IDLE:
Crochet?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yeah. Now she can't do without it. Twenty balls of wool a day, sometimes. If she can't get the wool she gets violent. What can we do about it?

ERIC IDLE:
But this is not just an old ladies' town. There are other equally dangerous gangs - such as the baby snatchers.

RITA DAVIES:
I just left my husband out here while I went in to do some shopping and I came back and he was gone. He was only forty-seven.

ERIC IDLE:
And on the road too, vicious gangs of keep left signs.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Right, right, stop it. This film's got silly. Started off with a nice little idea about grannies attacking young men, but now it's got silly. This man's hair is too long for a vicar too. These signs are pretty badly made. Right, now for a complete change of mood.

TERRY JONES:
I've heard of unisex but I've never had it.
