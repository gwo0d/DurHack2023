MICHAEL PALIN:
Well here in High Street Epsom, There are ample opportunities for all kinds of redevelopment. As you can see,

MICHAEL PALIN:
behind me now there are a high level of low density consumer units, still not fully maximizing site value. This could be radically improved by a carefully planned programme of demolition. And of course most of the occupants ere...er...elderly folks, so they wouldn't put up much of a fight.

ERIC IDLE:
Good afternoon. Well in fact there's still a few minutes to go before the main race on the card this afternoon - the Queen Victoria Handicap. So let's have a quick word with the winner of the last race, one of the season's top jockeys - Ronnie Mau-Mau.

ERIC IDLE:
Good afternoon, Ronnie.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good afternoon, Brian.

ERIC IDLE:
A very fine ride there, Ronnie.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, a fine horse, Brian. You know you can't go wrong.

ERIC IDLE:
Do you fancy your chances for the Derby?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh very definitely, very definitely, indeed, certainly Brian.

ERIC IDLE:
Well, let's just see if a colleague of yours agrees with that. Let's just have a quick word with Desmond Willet. Afternoon Des.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No chance, no chance at all.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, no I think you're wrong there, Des, with the right kind of going, he's going to be in there at the finish, Des.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No chance, there's no chance.

ERIC IDLE:
Well in fact I can see last season's top jockey, Johnny Knowles.

ERIC IDLE:
Good afternoon, Johnny.

ERIC IDLE:
Er, could we have a box for Johnny please.
