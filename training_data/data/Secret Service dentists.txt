JOHN CLEESE:
Er... oh!

ERIC IDLE:
Good morning, I'd like to buy a book please.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, well I'm afraid we don't have any.

ERIC IDLE:
I'm sorry?

JOHN CLEESE:
We don't have any books. We're fresh out of them. Good morning.

ERIC IDLE:
Well what are all these?

JOHN CLEESE:
All what? Oh! All these, ah ah ha ha. Your referring to these ... books.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes.

JOHN CLEESE:
They're um ... they're all sold. Good morning.

ERIC IDLE:
What

ERIC IDLE:
of them?

JOHN CLEESE:
Every single man Jack of them. Not a single one of them in an unsold state. Good morning.

ERIC IDLE:
Who to?

JOHN CLEESE:
What?

ERIC IDLE:
Who are they sold to?

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh ... various ... good Lord is that the time? Oh my goodness I must close for lunch.

ERIC IDLE:
It's only half past ten.

JOHN CLEESE:
Ah yes, well I feel rather peckish ... very peckish actually, I don't expect I'll open again today. I think I'll have a really good feed. I say! Look at that lovely bookshop just across the road there, they've got a much better selection than we've got, probably at ridiculously low prices ... just across the road there.

JOHN CLEESE:
Good morning.

ERIC IDLE:
But I was told to come here.

JOHN CLEESE:
Er .,. oh . .. I was just saying ... thinking of the weather.. I hear the gooseberries are doing well this year... and so are the mangoes.

ERIC IDLE:
Mine aren't

JOHN CLEESE:
Go on...

ERIC IDLE:
What?

JOHN CLEESE:
Go on - mine aren't ... but...

JOHN CLEESE:
Aren't you going to say something about 'mine aren't but the Big Cheese gets his at low tide tonight'?

ERIC IDLE:
No.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, ah, good morning,

JOHN CLEESE:
Wait. Who sent you?

ERIC IDLE:
The little old lady in the sweet shop.

JOHN CLEESE:
She didn't have a duelling scar just here ... and a hook?

JOHN CLEESE:
Of course not, I was thinking of somebody else. Good morning.

ERIC IDLE:
Wait a minute, there's something going on here.

JOHN CLEESE:
What, where? You didn't see anything did you?

ERIC IDLE:
No, but I think there's something going on here.

JOHN CLEESE:
No no, well there's nothing going on here at all

JOHN CLEESE:
and he didn't see anything. Good morning.

ERIC IDLE:
There is something going on.

JOHN CLEESE:
Look there is nothing going on. Please believe me, there is abso...

JOHN CLEESE:
. . . lutely nothing going on. Is there anything going on?

JOHN CLEESE:
See there's nothing going on.

ERIC IDLE:
Who was that?

JOHN CLEESE:
That was my aunt, look what was this book you wanted then? Quickly! Quickly!

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, well, I'd like to buy a copy of an 'Illustrated History of False Teeth'.

JOHN CLEESE:
My God you've got guts.

JOHN CLEESE:
Just how much do you know?

ERIC IDLE:
What about?

JOHN CLEESE:
Are you from the British Dental Association?

ERIC IDLE:
No I'm a tobacconist.

JOHN CLEESE:
Get away from that door.

ERIC IDLE:
I'll just go over the other...

JOHN CLEESE:
Stay where you are. You'll never leave this bookshop alive.

ERIC IDLE:
Why not?

JOHN CLEESE:
You know too much, my dental friend.

ERIC IDLE:
I don't know anything.

JOHN CLEESE:
Come clean. You're a dentist aren't you.

ERIC IDLE:
No, I'm a tobacconist.

JOHN CLEESE:
A tobacconist who just happens to be buying a book on ...teeth?

JOHN CLEESE:
Ha ha ha ha...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Drop that gun, Stapleton.

JOHN CLEESE:
Lafarge!

JOHN CLEESE:
No there isn't.

MICHAEL PALIN:
OK Stapleton, this is it. Where's Mahoney hidden the fillings?

JOHN CLEESE:
What fillings?

MICHAEL PALIN:
You know which fillings, Stapleton. Upper right two and four, lower right three and two lower left one. Come on.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Remember what happened to Nigel.

ERIC IDLE:
What happened to Nigel?

JOHN CLEESE:
Orthodontic Jake gave him a gelignite mouth wash.

ERIC IDLE:
I knew there was something going on.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well there isn't.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Come on Stapleton. The fillings!

JOHN CLEESE:
They're at 22 Wimpole Street.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Don't play games with me!

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, oh, 22a Wimpole Street.

MICHAEL PALIN:
That's better.

JOHN CLEESE:
But you'll need an appointment.

MICHAEL PALIN:
OK

MICHAEL PALIN:
Brian! Make with the appointment baby. No gas.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Van der Berg!

ERIC IDLE:
There

ERIC IDLE:
something going on.

ERIC IDLE:
Who's that?

JOHN CLEESE:
That's Van der Berg. He's on our side.

JOHN CLEESE:
Me?

JOHN CLEESE:
You dirty double-crossing rat.

ERIC IDLE:
What's happened?

JOHN CLEESE:
He's two-timed me.

ERIC IDLE:
Bad luck.

ERIC IDLE:
This is quite exciting.

TERRY JONES:
Not so fast.

ERIC IDLE:
Ooh, what's that?

TERRY JONES:
All right. Get against the wall Van der Berg ... and you nurse. And the first one to try anything moves to a practice six feet underground ... this is an anti-tank gun ... and it's loaded ...and you've just got five seconds to tell me ... whatever happened to Baby Jane?

TERRY JONES:
Oh ... I'm sorry ... my mind was wandering ... I've had a terrible day... I really have ... you've got five seconds to tell me... I've forgotten. I've forgotten.

JOHN CLEESE:
The five seconds haven't started yet have they?

ERIC IDLE:
Was it about Vogler?

TERRY JONES:
No, no... no ... you've got five seconds to tell me...

TERRY JONES:
No.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Bronski?

TERRY JONES:
No. No.

ERIC IDLE:
The fillings!

TERRY JONES:
Oh yes, the fillings, of course. How stupid of me. Right, you've got five seconds ...

TERRY JONES:
Five, four, three, two, one.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Drop the bazooka Brian.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'm glad you could all come to my little ... party. And Flopsy's glad too, aren't you, Flopsy?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
And because I'm so evil you'll all die the slow way ... under the drill.

ERIC IDLE:
lt's one o'clock.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
So it is. Lunch break, everyone back here at two.

ERIC IDLE:
Hallo ... give me the British Dental Association ... and fast.

ERIC IDLE:
You see, I knew there was something going on. Of course, the Big Cheese made two mistakes. First of all he didn't recognize me: Lemming, Arthur Lemming, Special Investigator, British Dental Association, and second ...

ERIC IDLE:
spit ... by the time I got back from lunch I had every dental surgeon in SW1 waiting for them all in the broom cupboard. Funny isn't it, how naughty dentists always make that one fatal mistake. Bye for now ... keep your teeth clean.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Right! No, I warned you, no, I warned you about the slogan, right. That's the end. Stop the programme! Stop it.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ah! Got you my lad. Still acting eh? Over you go!
