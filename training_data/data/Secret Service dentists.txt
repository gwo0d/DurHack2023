JOHN CLEESE:
Oh ... various ... good Lord is that the time? Oh my goodness I must close for lunch.

ERIC IDLE:
It's only half past ten.

JOHN CLEESE:
Ah yes, well I feel rather peckish ... very peckish actually, I don't expect I'll open again today. I think I'll have a really good feed. I say! Look at that lovely bookshop just across the road there, they've got a much better selection than we've got, probably at ridiculously low prices ... just across the road there.

DIRECTION:

JOHN CLEESE:

nodding keenly, with anticipation

JOHN CLEESE:
Go on...

ERIC IDLE:
What?

JOHN CLEESE:
Go on - mine aren't ... but...

JOHN CLEESE:

ERIC IDLE:
No.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, ah, good morning,

DIRECTION:
starts to bundle him out then stops

JOHN CLEESE:
Wait. Who sent you?

ERIC IDLE:
The little old lady in the sweet shop.

JOHN CLEESE:
She didn't have a duelling scar just here ... and a hook?

JOHN CLEESE:
Of course not, I was thinking of somebody else. Good morning.

ERIC IDLE:
Wait a minute, there's something going on here.

DIRECTION:
spinning round.

JOHN CLEESE:
What, where? You didn't see anything did you?

ERIC IDLE:
No, but I think there's something going on here.

JOHN CLEESE:
No no, well there's nothing going on here at all

DIRECTION:
shouts off

JOHN CLEESE:
and he didn't see anything. Good morning.

DIRECTION:
coming back into shop

ERIC IDLE:
There is something going on.

JOHN CLEESE:
Look there is nothing going on. Please believe me, there is abso...

DIRECTION:
a hand comes into view behind Arthur's back; Bookseller frantically waves at it to disappear; it does so

JOHN CLEESE:
. . . lutely nothing going on. Is there anything going on?

DIRECTION:
A man appears, fleetingly: he is Van der Berg (Dick Vosburgh)

DIRECTION:
No there's nothing going on.

DIRECTION:
disappears

JOHN CLEESE:
See there's nothing going on.

ERIC IDLE:
Who was that?

JOHN CLEESE:
That was my aunt, look what was this book you wanted then? Quickly! Quickly!

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, well, I'd like to buy a copy of an 'Illustrated History of False Teeth'.

JOHN CLEESE:
My God you've got guts.

pulling gun

JOHN CLEESE:
Just how much do you know?

ERIC IDLE:
What about?

JOHN CLEESE:
Are you from the British Dental Association?

ERIC IDLE:
No I'm a tobacconist.

JOHN CLEESE:
Get away from that door.

ERIC IDLE:
I'll just go over the other...

JOHN CLEESE:
Stay where you are. You'll never leave this bookshop alive.

ERIC IDLE:
Why not?

JOHN CLEESE:
You know too much, my dental friend.

ERIC IDLE:
I don't know anything.

JOHN CLEESE:
Come clean. You're a dentist aren't you.

ERIC IDLE:
No, I'm a tobacconist.

JOHN CLEESE:
A tobacconist who just happens to be buying a book on ...teeth?

JOHN CLEESE:
Ha ha ha ha...

DIRECTION:
Lafarge enters room with gun. He is swarthy, French, dressed all in black and menacing.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Drop that gun, Stapleton.

JOHN CLEESE:
Lafarge!

DIRECTION:
he drops the gun

JOHN CLEESE:
No there isn't.

MICHAEL PALIN:
OK Stapleton, this is it. Where's Mahoney hidden the fillings?

JOHN CLEESE:
What fillings?

MICHAEL PALIN:
You know which fillings, Stapleton. Upper right two and four, lower right three and two lower left one. Come on.

DIRECTION:
he threatens with the gun

MICHAEL PALIN:
Remember what happened to Nigel.

ERIC IDLE:
What happened to Nigel?

JOHN CLEESE:
Orthodontic Jake gave him a gelignite mouth wash.

ERIC IDLE:
I knew there was something going on.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well there isn't.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Come on Stapleton. The fillings!

JOHN CLEESE:
They're at 22 Wimpole Street.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Don't play games with me!

DIRECTION:
pokes bookseller in eye with the gun

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, oh, 22a Wimpole Street.

MICHAEL PALIN:
That's better.

JOHN CLEESE:
But you'll need an appointment.

MICHAEL PALIN:
OK

DIRECTION:
shouting out of shop

MICHAEL PALIN:
Brian! Make with the appointment baby. No gas.

DIRECTION:
Van der Berg appears with machine gun and a nurse (Carol), he is basically dressed as a dentist. But with many rings, chains, wristlets, cravats, buckled shoes and an ear-ring.

DIRECTION:
Not so fast Lafarge!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Van der Berg!

DIRECTION:
Yes. Now drop the roscoe.

ERIC IDLE:
There

DIRECTION:
is

ERIC IDLE:
something going on.

DIRECTION:
Get the guns.

DIRECTION:
The nurse runs forward, picks up the gun and puts it on steel surgeon's tray, and covers it with a white cloth, returning it to Van der Berg.

ERIC IDLE:
Who's that?

JOHN CLEESE:
That's Van der Berg. He's on our side.

DIRECTION:
All right, get up against the wall Lafarge, and you too Stapleton.

JOHN CLEESE:
Me?

DIRECTION:
Yes, you!

JOHN CLEESE:
You dirty double-crossing rat.

DIRECTION:
going with Bookseller

ERIC IDLE:
What's happened?

JOHN CLEESE:
He's two-timed me.

ERIC IDLE:
Bad luck.

DIRECTION:
All right ... where are the fillings? Answer me, where are they?

ERIC IDLE:
This is quite exciting.

DIRECTION:
Brian enters carrying a bazooka. Brian is dressed in operating-theatre clothes, gown, cap and mask, with rubber gloves and white wellingtons.

TERRY JONES:
Not so fast.

DIRECTION:
Brian!

ERIC IDLE:
Ooh, what's that?

DIRECTION:
It's a bazooka.

TERRY JONES:
All right. Get against the wall Van der Berg ... and you nurse. And the first one to try anything moves to a practice six feet underground ... this is an anti-tank gun ... and it's loaded ...and you've just got five seconds to tell me ... whatever happened to Baby Jane?

DIRECTION:
What?

TERRY JONES:
Oh ... I'm sorry ... my mind was wandering ... I've had a terrible day... I really have ... you've got five seconds to tell me... I've forgotten. I've forgotten.

JOHN CLEESE:
The five seconds haven't started yet have they?

DIRECTION:
Only we don't know the question.

ERIC IDLE:
Was it about Vogler?

TERRY JONES:
No, no... no ... you've got five seconds to tell me...

DIRECTION:
About Nigel?

TERRY JONES:
No.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Bronski?

TERRY JONES:
No. No.

ERIC IDLE:
The fillings!

TERRY JONES:
Oh yes, the fillings, of course. How stupid of me. Right, you've got five seconds ...

DIRECTION:
clears throat

DIRECTION:
there is a long pause, Brian has forgotten to fire the bazooka but he can't put his finger on what has gone wrong

DIRECTION:
looks at gun

DIRECTION:
quite rapidly

TERRY JONES:
Five, four, three, two, one.

DIRECTION:
A panel slides back and the Big Cheese appears in sight seated in adentist's chair. The Big Cheese is in dentist's gear, wears evil magnifing type glasses and strokes a rabbit lying on his lap.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Drop the bazooka Brian.

DIRECTION:
The Big Cheese!

DIRECTION:
Brian drops the bazooka.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'm glad you could all come to my little ... party. And Flopsy's glad too, aren't you, Flopsy?

DIRECTION:
he holds rabbit up as it does not reply

DIRECTION:
no reply again so he pulls a big revolver out and fires at rabbit from point-blank range

DIRECTION:
the crowd start to hiss him

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
And because I'm so evil you'll all die the slow way ... under the drill.

ERIC IDLE:
lt's one o'clock.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
So it is. Lunch break, everyone back here at two.

DIRECTION:
They, all happily relax and walk off. Arthur surreptitiously goes to telephone and, making sure nobody is looking, calls.

ERIC IDLE:
Hallo ... give me the British Dental Association ... and fast.

DIRECTION:
Cut to Arthur dressed normally as dentist leaning over patient in chair. He looks up to camera.

ERIC IDLE:
You see, I knew there was something going on. Of course, the Big Cheese made two mistakes. First of all he didn't recognize me: Lemming, Arthur Lemming, Special Investigator, British Dental Association, and second ...

DIRECTION:
to patient

ERIC IDLE:
spit ... by the time I got back from lunch I had every dental surgeon in SW1 waiting for them all in the broom cupboard. Funny isn't it, how naughty dentists always make that one fatal mistake. Bye for now ... keep your teeth clean.

DIRECTION:
Cut to photo of Arthur Lemming

DIRECTION:
SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'LEMMING OF THE BDA'

DIRECTION:
Over this we hear a song which Graham knows the tune of.

DIRECTION:
Voice over pre-recorded

Lemming, Lemming ... Lemming of the BDA .. Lemming, Lemming ... Lemming of the BD ...Lemming of the BD ... BD, BDA.

DIRECTION:
and CAPTION:

DIRECTION:
'IT'S A MAN'S LIFE IN THE BRITISH DENTAL ASSOCIATION'

DIRECTION:
knocking the photo aside

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Right! No, I warned you, no, I warned you about the slogan, right. That's the end. Stop the programme! Stop it.

DIRECTION:
Cut to referee blowing whistle.

DIRECTION:
The 'It's' man, lying on beach. is poked with a stick from off-screen. He gets up and limps away.

DIRECTION:
CAPTION: '"OWL-STRETCHING TIME" WAS CONCIEVED, WRITTEN AND PERFORMED BY...(CREDITS)'

DIRECTION:
End titles finishes as the 'It's' man reaches the top of the cliff and disappears. As soon as he has disappeared we hear:

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ah! Got you my lad. Still acting eh? Over you go!

DIRECTION:
'It's' man reappears hurled back over cliff.
