ERIC IDLE:
There they go, the credits of the year. Credits that you and the Society voted as the credits that brought the most credit to the Society. Sadly, the man who designed them cannot be with us tonight, as he is at home asleep, but we are going to wake him up and tell him the good news.

ERIC IDLE:
Are you there in Bristol, Arthur Briggs...?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, my God!

ERIC IDLE:
And now for the moment you've all been waiting for...

ERIC IDLE:
No, not that moment. Although that moment is coming,

ERIC IDLE:
a moment. The moment I'm talking about is the moment when we present the award for the cast with the most awards award, and this year is no exception. Ladies and gentlemen will you join me and welcome please, the winners of this year's Mountbatten trophy, Showbusiness's highest accolade, the cast of the dirty Vicar sketch.

ERIC IDLE:
Well now, let us see the performances which brought them this award. Let us see the Dirty Vicar sketch.
