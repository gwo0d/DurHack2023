Pull out from screen to see that this is on the screen in the awards set and Dickie is working a stirrup pump which pumps tears out from the side of his head via rather obvious tubes.

ERIC IDLE:
There they go, the credits of the year. Credits that you and the Society voted as the credits that brought the most credit to the Society. Sadly, the man who designed them cannot be with us tonight, as he is at home asleep, but we are going to wake him up and tell him the good news.

DIRECTION:
We see a darkened bedroom. The light is suddenly switched on. A man sits up. He has no clothes on.

ERIC IDLE:
Are you there in Bristol, Arthur Briggs...?

DIRECTION:
Briggs looks terrified. We see that another man (John) is in bed with him.
