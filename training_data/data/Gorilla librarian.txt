TERRY JONES:
Here what was that picture?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ssh! Next!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Good morning - Mr Phipps?

ERIC IDLE:
That's right, yes.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Er, do take a seat.

ERIC IDLE:
Right sir.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Now could you tell us roughly why you want to become a librarian?

ERIC IDLE:
Er, well, I've had a certain amount of experience running a library at school.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, yes. What sort of experience?

ERIC IDLE:
Er, well for a time I ran the Upper Science Library.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, yes. Now Mr Phipps, you do realize that the post of librarian carries with it certain very important responsibilities. I mean, there's the selection of books, the record library, and the art gallery. Now it seems to me that your greatest disadvantage is your lack of professional experience ... coupled with the fact that, uh, being a gorilla, you would tend to frighten people.

TERRY JONES:
Is he a gorilla?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes he is.

TERRY JONES:
Well why didn't it say on his form that he's a gorilla?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, you see applicants are not required to fill in their species.

TERRY JONES:
What was that picture?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Sh! ... Mr Phipps, what is your attitude toward censorship in a public library?

ERIC IDLE:
How do you mean, sir?

TERRY JONES:
Well I mean for instance, would you for instance stock 'Last Exit to Brooklyn'... or ... 'Groupie'?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, I think so.

TERRY JONES:
Good.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, well, that seems to me to be very sensible Mr Phipps. I can't pretend that this library hasn't had its difficulties ... Mr Robertson, your predecessor, an excellent librarian, savaged three people last week and had to be destroyed.

ERIC IDLE:
I'm sorry sir.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, no, don't be sorry. You see, I don't believe that libraries should be drab places where people sit in silence, and that's been the main reason for our policy of employing wild animals as librarians.

TERRY JONES:
And also, they're much more permissive. Pumas keep Hank Janson on open shelves...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes. Yes. Yes.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Mr Phipps ... Kong! You can be our next librarian - you're proud, majestic and fierce enough ... will you do it?

ERIC IDLE:
I ... don't think I can sir.

TERRY JONES:
Why not?

ERIC IDLE:
I.. I'm not really a gorilla.

TERRY JONES:
Eh?

ERIC IDLE:
I'm a librarian in a skin.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Why this deception?

ERIC IDLE:
Well, they said it was the best way to get the job.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Get out, Mr Librarian Phipps, seeing as you're not a gorilla, but only dressed up as one, trying to deceive us in order to further your career ...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ah. Mr Pattinson ... Sit!
