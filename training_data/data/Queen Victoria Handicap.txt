CAPTION: '3.15 QUEEN VICTORIA HANDICAP'

ERIC IDLE:
Well they're under starter's orders for this very valuable Queen Victoria Handicap. And they're off,

DIRECTION:
the starting stall doors fly open; out come eight identically dressed Queen Victorias who go bustling off up the field

DIRECTION:
a low angle shot as the Queen Victorias appear over the fence and thunder towards the camera

ERIC IDLE:
And at the first fence it's Queen Victoria just ahead of Queen Victoria and Queen Victoria falling away in third place. And Queen Victoria in the lead as they ...

DIRECTION:
Cut back to the presenter in the studio; he is completely dressed as Queen Victoria, apart from his face.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well a very exciting race there at Epsom. And now over to the European Cup at Barcelona where the latest news is that Miguel Otana, the burly Real Madrid striker, was sent off for breaking wind in the forty-third minute. He'd already been cautioned for pursing his lips earlier on in the game and now he's off! So let's see a playback of that ... Brian.

DIRECTION:
Cut to Brian, dressed the same way.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes ... er ... well as you can see ... there's Otana now

DIRECTION:
brief stock shot of football match

DIRECTION:
cut back to Brian

ERIC IDLE:
and er ... he makes no attempt to play the ball. He quite deliberately lets off! And to my mind he was within the box and the referee had no option whatsoever but to send him off.

DIRECTION:
Cut to the presenter.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Jimmy?

DIRECTION:
We cut to the real Jimmy Hill dressed as Queen Victoria, veil, crown and all.

DIRECTION:
Good evening.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What do you make of that?

DIRECTION:
Well the referees really are clamping down these days. Only last week the Belgian captain was sent off for having a Sony radio cassette player. And Gonerelli, the huge Italian defender, was sent off in Turin for having his sitting and dining room knocked through to form an open living area.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hamlet?

DIRECTION:
Cut to Hamlet.

TERRY JONES:
Good evening.

DIRECTION:
Cut quickly back to the presenter.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well you've got the girl on the bed and her legs up on the mantelpiece ...

CAPTION: 'ACT FIVE - A HAM IN THE CASTLE'

DIRECTION:
Mix to the theatre set we saw before. All the cast are dressed as Queen Victorias, except for Hamlet and Ophelia.

Let four captains bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage. For he was likely had he been put on to have proved most royally ...
