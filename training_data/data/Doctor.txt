How's the old arm this morning, Mrs Ikon?

Oh, it's still hanging off at the shoulder.

TERRY JONES:
Good, well lets have a look at it, shall we?

Oh damn, damn, damn, damn... damn this wretched bag... oh the wretched, damn, bloody, little bag. It's the one thing I hate about being a doctor - it's this wretched bloody little bag!

Eurgggh!

Hand over the money.

Thank you, doctor.
