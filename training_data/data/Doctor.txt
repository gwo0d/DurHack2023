TERRY JONES:
Good morning.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, morning, doctor.

TERRY JONES:
How's the old arm this morning, Mrs Ikon?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, it's still hanging off at the shoulder.

TERRY JONES:
Good, well lets have a look at it, shall we?

DIRECTION:
he tries unsuccessfully to open his bag

TERRY JONES:
Oh damn, damn, damn, damn... damn this wretched bag... oh the wretched, damn, bloody, little bag. It's the one thing I hate about being a doctor - it's this wretched bloody little bag!

DIRECTION:
He smashes a chair over it and finally produces a revolver and shoots the lock off. It opens and is stuffed full of pound notes, some of which spill out. He feels inside... eventually pulls out a stethoscope.

TERRY JONES:
What's that doing here?

DIRECTION:
he throws it away

DIRECTION:
Cut to another doctor walking along a street. The stethoscope flies out of window and lands on him.

DIRECTION:
brushing it off

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Eurgggh!

DIRECTION:
Cut back to the first doctor still rummaging in black bag. Eventually, he produces a pair of black kid gloves and a black handkerchief. He folds it and puts it on and points the gun at Mrs Trepidatious.

TERRY JONES:
Hand over the money.

DIRECTION:
she goes to a sideboard opens the bottom drawer and gets out a money box which she gives to him

DIRECTION:
she looks scared; he jabs the gun at her; she goes over to a painting of a wall-safe on the wall and pushes it aside to reveal an identical wall-safe underneath. She opens it and a hand comes out holding a money box; she takes and gives it to the doctor

DIRECTION:
he opens his mac like a flasher; they scream and jump

DIRECTION:
he starts to go up

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Thank you, doctor.

DIRECTION:
he disappears

DIRECTION:
Cut to a hospital ward. A man in bed, a chair with his clothes on it at the foot of the bed. A doctor entes and goes right for the jacket and starts to feel in the pockets.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Morning, Mr Henson ... How are we today?

TERRY GILLIAM:
Not too bad, doctor.

MICHAEL PALIN:
OK, take it easy ...

DIRECTION:
he empties his wallet and puts it back

MICHAEL PALIN:
Expecting any postal orders this week?

TERRY GILLIAM:
No.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Righto.

DIRECTION:
A nurse comes and gets the loose change. The doctor goes to the next bed where there is a man entirely in traction.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah, Mr Rodgers, have you got your unemployment benefit please? Right. Well can you write me a cheque then... please?

DIRECTION:
The patient writes him a cheque. He goes to the foot of the bed. There is a graph with a money symbol on it. He marks it down further.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Thank you very much. Soon have you down to nothing. Ah, Mr Millichope.

DIRECTION:
he smiles and leaves, passing a man with a saline drip full of coins; chink of money

DIRECTION:
A Gilliam animation suitably connected with the foregoing concept leads us to a TV debate set-up. Stern music starts as the lights come on.
