MICHAEL PALIN:
Good afternoon and welcome to Wife-Swapping from Redcar. And the big news this morning is that the British boy Boris Rodgers has succeeded in swapping his nine-stone Welsh-born wife for a Ford Popular and a complete set of Dickens. Well now, I can see they're ready at the start and so let's go now over for the start of the 3.30.

DIRECTION:
Cut to high shot of a street with about 10 houses on each side.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And first let's catch up with the latest news of the betting.

DIRECTION:
SUPERIMPOSED CAPTIONS:

DIRECTION:
'NO. 12 BETTY PARKINSON

ERIC IDLE:
Number 12 Betty Parkinson 7 to 4 on favourite, number 27 Mrs Colyer 9 to 4, 5 to 1 bar those.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And here's the starter Mrs Alec Marsh,

DIRECTION:
she climbs onto a rostrum and fires a gun

MICHAEL PALIN:
and they're off.

DIRECTION:
One of the doors opens and a lady rushes across the street into another house. Other doors start opening up and down the street, wiith ladies criss-crossing out of each others houses. About twenty seconds of this high activity.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And Mrs Rodgers is the frirst to show, there she goes into Mr Johnson's, and Mrs Johnson across too Mr Colyer, followed closely by Mrs Casey on the inside. Mrs Parkinson, number 12, going well there into Mr Webster's from the Co-op, Mrs Colyer's making ground fast after a poor start, she's out of Mr Casey's into Mr Parkinson's, she's a couple og lengths ahead of Mrs Johnson who's still not out of Mr Casey's. Mrs Penguin and Mrs Colyer - these two now at the head of the field from Mrs Brown, Mrs Atkins, Mrs Parkinson, Mrs Warner and Mrs Rudd - all still at Mr Phillip's. Mrs Penguin making the running now, challenged strongly by Mrs Casey, Mars Casey coming very fast on the inside, it's going to be Mrs Casey coming from behind. Now she's making a break on the outside, Mrs Penguin running...and at the line it's Mrs Casey who's got it by a short head from Mrs Penguin in second place, Mrs Parkinson in third, Mrs Rudd, Mrs Colyer, Mrs Warner and there's Mrs Griffiths who's remained unswapped.

DIRECTION:
One lady is left in the middle of the road. Cut back to Rickman at the course railing.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, a very exciting race there, and I have with me now the man who owned and trained the winner, Mrs Casey - Mr Casey. Well done, Jack.

TERRY JONES:
Thank you, John.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, were you at all surprised about this, Jack?

TERRY JONES:
No, not really, no she's been going very well in training, and at Doncaster last week, and I fancy her very strongly for the Cheltenham weekend.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, thank you very much indeed, Jack. We must leave you now because it's time for the team event.

DIRECTION:
Peter West type figure in a white DJ sitting at a ballroom side table. He has one or two ballroom dancers beside him.

DIRECTION:
SUPERIMPOSED TITLES: 'COME WIFE-SWAPPING - NORTH WEST V THE SOUTH EAST'

ERIC IDLE:
Hello, and a very warm welcome from the Tower ballroom suite at Reading, where there's very little in it, they're neck and neck, crop and grummit, real rack and saddle, brick and bucket, horse and tooth, cap and thigh, arse over tip, they're absolutely birds of a feather, there's not a new pin in it, you couldn't get a melon between them. Well, now, everything rests on the formation event and here come North West with the Mambo.

DIRECTION:
Cut to line of ballroom dancers being led out. Four gentlemen and four ladies in each team, sixteen altogether.

ERIC IDLE:
Maestro, take it away, please.

DIRECTION:
The dancers form up in two lines opposite each other, as though they are about to dance. The ladies are in nasty tulle, the gents in tails, with numbers on their backs. At the back of the hall a large banner says 'Mecca Wife-Swapping'. Mambo music starts its intro. After four bars the two teams starts grapping each other and wrestling on the ground. A vast orgy breaks out as they roll all over the floor. Cut quickly to Frank Bough in the 'Sportsview' studio.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And now it's time for Rugby League, and highlights of this afternoon's game between Keighley and Hull Kingston Rovers.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a field where mud-caked rugby league players in hooped shirts are getting ready for a scrum.

DIRECTION:
voice over

ERIC IDLE:
Well, good afternoon and as you can see, Hull Kingston Rovers are well in the lead, it's a scrum down on the twenty-five, Keighley's Tom Colyer with the put in, Mrs Colyer to be put.

DIRECTION:
The scrum has formed up, the scrum half has a dummy woman, small and light, but real looking, tucked under his arm, while he steadies the scrum. He puts her into the scrum, and after a lot of kicking she is eventually heeled out.

ERIC IDLE:
And there goes his wife into the scrum. And Hull have got the heel against the head. Doing nicely with this scrum, some very good packing here. Warrington's picked her up, is he going to let her go, Wrigley's with him, grand lad is this.

DIRECTION:
Mrs Colyer is picked up by the scrum half who makes a run with her. Handing off a strong tackle and dodging with her, he side steps amd slips Mrs Colyer to a back who makes a run through and touches her down between the posts. They leave the lady dumped down between the posts and rush to congratulate and hug each other.

ERIC IDLE:
Well, that was right on the whistle, Rovers walkin' it there, winnin' easily by twenty-six points to two.

DIRECTION:
Cut to Frank Bough again in the 'Sportsview' set.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Just a reminder that on 'Match of the Day' tonight you can see highlights of two of this afternoon's big games. Mrs Robinson v Manchester United and Southampton v Mr Rogers, a rather unusual game that. And here's a late result...Convetry nil, Mr Johnson's Una three - Coventry going down at home, there. Just a little reminder that the next sport you can see on BBS 1 will be 9.20 on Wednesday night, when 'Wife Swapping with Coleman' comes live from my place. Till then, goodnight.
