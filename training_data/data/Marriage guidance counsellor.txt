DIRECTION:
Cut to a man holding up cards saying 'Marriage Counsellor'. The counsellor sits behind a desk. He puts down the card and says:

ERIC IDLE:
Next!

DIRECTION:
A little man enters, with a beautiful blond buxom wench, in the full bloom of her young womanhood (Carol Cleveland)

MICHAEL PALIN:
Are you the marriage guidance counsellor?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes. Good morning

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good morning, sir

DIRECTION:
stares at the wife, fascinated

DIRECTION:
pauses, he shrugs himself out of it, says to man...

ERIC IDLE:
Name?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Mr and Mrs Arthur Pewtey, Pewtey.

DIRECTION:
writes without looking down, just stares at the wife

DIRECTION:
holds up hand

ERIC IDLE:
Wait. Don't tell me - it's something to do with moonlight - it goes with her eyes - it's soft and gentle, warm and yeilding, deeply lyrical and yet tender and frightened like a tiny whit rabbit

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's Deirdre

ERIC IDLE:
Deirdre. What a beautiful name. What a beautiful, beautiful name

DIRECTION:
leans across and lightly brushes his hand accross the wife's cheek

ERIC IDLE:
And what seems to be the trouble with your marriage Mr Pewtey?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, it all started about five years ago when we started going on holiday to Brighton together. Deirdre, that's my wife, has always been a jolly good companion to me and I never particularly anticipated any marital strife - indeed the very idea of consulting a professional marital adviser has always been of the greatest repugnance to me although far be it from me to impugn the nature of your trade or profession

DIRECTION:
The counsellor and wife are not listening, fascinated by each other.

DIRECTION:
realizing Pewtey has stopped

ERIC IDLE:
Do go on.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, as I say, we've always been good friends, sharing the interests, the gardening and so on, the model aeroplanes, the sixpenny bottle for the holiday money, and indeed twice a month settling down in the evenings doing the accounts, something which, er, Deirdre, Deirdre that's my wife, er, particularly looked forward to on account of her feet

DIRECTION:
the counsellor has his face fantastically close to the wife's, as close that they could get without kissing

MICHAEL PALIN:
I should probably have said at the outset that I'm noted for having something of a sense of humour, although I have kept myself very much to myself over the last two years notwithstanding, as it were, and it's only as comparatively recently that I began to realize - well, er prehaps realize is not the correct word, er, imagine, imagine, that I was not the only thing in her life

DIRECTION:
who is practically in a clinch with her

ERIC IDLE:
You suspected your wife?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well yes - at first, frankly yes

DIRECTION:
the counsellor points the wife to a screen; she goes behind it

MICHAEL PALIN:
Her behaviour did seem at the time to me, who after all was there to see, to be a little odd.

ERIC IDLE:
Odd?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes well, I mean to a certain extent yes. I'm not by nature a suspicious person - far from it - though in fact I have something of a reputation as an after-dinner speaker, if you take my meaning....

DIRECTION:
A piece of his wife's clothing comes over the top of the screen.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes I certainly do

DIRECTION:
The wife's bra and panties come over the screen.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Anyway in the area where I'm known people in fact know me extremely well....

DIRECTION:
taking his jacket off

ERIC IDLE:
Oh yes. Would you hold this.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Certainly yes

DIRECTION:
helps him with it; the counsellor continues to undress

MICHAEL PALIN:
Anyway, as I said, I decided to face up to the facts and stop beating about the bush or I'd never look myself in the bathroom mirror again.

DIRECTION:
down to his shorts

ERIC IDLE:
Er, look would you mind running along for ten minutes? Make it half an hour.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, no, right-ho, fine. Yes I'll wait outside shall I?...

DIRECTION:
the cousellor has already gone behind the screen

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, well that's p'raps the best things. Yes. You've certainly put my mind at rest on one or two points, there.

DIRECTION:
Exits through door. He is stopped by a deep southern American voice.

JOHN CLEESE:
Now wait there stranger. A man can run and run for year after year until he realizes      that what he's running from...is hisself

MICHAEL PALIN:
Gosh.

JOHN CLEESE:
A man's got to do what a man's got to do, and there ain't no sense in runnin'. Now      you gotta turn, and you gotta fight, and you gotta hold your head up high.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes!

JOHN CLEESE:
Now you go back in there my son and be a man. Walk tall.

DIRECTION:
he exits

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, I will. I will. I've been pushed around long enough. This is it. This is your monent Arthur Pewtey - this is it Arthur Pewtey. At last you're a man!

DIRECTION:
open the door very determinedly

MICHAEL PALIN:
All right, Dierdre, come out of there

ERIC IDLE:
Go away

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right. Right.

DIRECTION:
He is hit on the head with a chicken by a man in a suit of armour.

DIRECTION:
CAPTION: 'SO MUCH FOR PATHOS'

JOHN CLEESE:
So much for pathos.
