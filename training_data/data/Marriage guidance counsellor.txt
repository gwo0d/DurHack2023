ERIC IDLE:
Next!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Are you the marriage guidance counsellor?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes. Good morning

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good morning, sir

ERIC IDLE:
Name?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Mr and Mrs Arthur Pewtey, Pewtey.

ERIC IDLE:
Wait. Don't tell me - it's something to do with moonlight - it goes with her eyes - it's soft and gentle, warm and yeilding, deeply lyrical and yet tender and frightened like a tiny whit rabbit

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's Deirdre

ERIC IDLE:
Deirdre. What a beautiful name. What a beautiful, beautiful name

ERIC IDLE:
And what seems to be the trouble with your marriage Mr Pewtey?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, it all started about five years ago when we started going on holiday to Brighton together. Deirdre, that's my wife, has always been a jolly good companion to me and I never particularly anticipated any marital strife - indeed the very idea of consulting a professional marital adviser has always been of the greatest repugnance to me although far be it from me to impugn the nature of your trade or profession

ERIC IDLE:
Do go on.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, as I say, we've always been good friends, sharing the interests, the gardening and so on, the model aeroplanes, the sixpenny bottle for the holiday money, and indeed twice a month settling down in the evenings doing the accounts, something which, er, Deirdre, Deirdre that's my wife, er, particularly looked forward to on account of her feet

MICHAEL PALIN:
I should probably have said at the outset that I'm noted for having something of a sense of humour, although I have kept myself very much to myself over the last two years notwithstanding, as it were, and it's only as comparatively recently that I began to realize - well, er prehaps realize is not the correct word, er, imagine, imagine, that I was not the only thing in her life

ERIC IDLE:
You suspected your wife?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well yes - at first, frankly yes

MICHAEL PALIN:
Her behaviour did seem at the time to me, who after all was there to see, to be a little odd.

ERIC IDLE:
Odd?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes well, I mean to a certain extent yes. I'm not by nature a suspicious person - far from it - though in fact I have something of a reputation as an after-dinner speaker, if you take my meaning....

ERIC IDLE:
Yes I certainly do

MICHAEL PALIN:
Anyway in the area where I'm known people in fact know me extremely well....

ERIC IDLE:
Oh yes. Would you hold this.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Certainly yes

MICHAEL PALIN:
Anyway, as I said, I decided to face up to the facts and stop beating about the bush or I'd never look myself in the bathroom mirror again.

ERIC IDLE:
Er, look would you mind running along for ten minutes? Make it half an hour.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, no, right-ho, fine. Yes I'll wait outside shall I?...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, well that's p'raps the best things. Yes. You've certainly put my mind at rest on one or two points, there.

JOHN CLEESE:
Now wait there stranger. A man can run and run for year after year until he realizes      that what he's running from...is hisself

MICHAEL PALIN:
Gosh.

JOHN CLEESE:
A man's got to do what a man's got to do, and there ain't no sense in runnin'. Now      you gotta turn, and you gotta fight, and you gotta hold your head up high.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes!

JOHN CLEESE:
Now you go back in there my son and be a man. Walk tall.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, I will. I will. I've been pushed around long enough. This is it. This is your monent Arthur Pewtey - this is it Arthur Pewtey. At last you're a man!

MICHAEL PALIN:
All right, Dierdre, come out of there

ERIC IDLE:
Go away

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right. Right.

JOHN CLEESE:
So much for pathos.
