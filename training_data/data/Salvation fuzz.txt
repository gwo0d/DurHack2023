All right I'll have the dead unjugged rabbit fish.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Hello, mum, hello, dad.

ERIC IDLE:
Hello, son.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
There's a dead bishop on the landing.

TERRY JONES:
Where did that come from?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What do you mean?

TERRY JONES:
What's its diocese?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well it looked a bit Bath and Wellsish to me.

ERIC IDLE:
I'll go and have a look.

DIRECTION:
goes out

TERRY JONES:
I don't know who keeps bringing them in here.

DIRECTION:
coming back

ERIC IDLE:
Leicester.

TERRY JONES:
How do you know?

ERIC IDLE:
Tattooed on the back of his neck. I'm going to call the police.

TERRY JONES:
Shouldn't you call the Church?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Call the Church police.

ERIC IDLE:

DIRECTION:
shouts

ERIC IDLE:
The Church police!

DIRECTION:
Enter two policemen with ecclesiastical accoutrements.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yus?

TERRY JONES:
There's another dead bishop on the landing.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Suffragan or diocesan?

TERRY JONES:
How should I know?

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's tatooed on the back of their neck. Ere! Is that rat tart?

TERRY JONES:
Yes.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Disgusting! Right! The hunt is on.

DIRECTION:
kneels

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh Lord we beseech thee tell us who croaked Leicester.

DIRECTION:
Organ music. A huge hand descends and points at the man.

ERIC IDLE:
All right, it's a fair cop, but society is to blame.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Agreed.

ERIC IDLE:
I would like the three by the bin to be taken into consideration.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right. And now, I'd like to conclude this arrest with a hymn.

DIRECTION:
singing

DIRECTION:
policemen escort the man out

DIRECTION:
And was the holy lamb of God on England's pleasant pastures seen.

DIRECTION:
ANIMATION:

DIRECTION:
bouncing Queen Victoria.

DIRECTION:
Meanwhile in the jungle next door.

DIRECTION:
A steamy tropical jungle. A native guide leads four explorers in pith helmets and old-fashioned long shorts through the jungle. Cicada sounds and shrieks of predatory jungle birds. Intercut close ups of perspiring foreheads etc. The native guide keeps beckoning them to hurry. The jungle appears to get thicker: they have to push their way through the undergrowth. Finally the guide stops and points, with eyes staring. The four explorers cluster around and look over his shoulder. A neat clearing in the thick of the jungle. Tables set as in a London bistro with check cloths and big wooden pepper mills, candles and menus standing on each table. Sitting at the tables are six other explorers in pith helmets etc., eating and chatting. Clink of coffee cups.

JOHN CLEESE:
What a simply super little place!

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, they've done wonders with it. You know this used to be one of the most swampy disease infested areas of the whole jungle, and they've turned it into this smashing little restaurant.

DIRECTION:
across the restaurant the head waiter appears, dressed in black tie and tails just a bit too big for him; he beckons them to a table

ERIC IDLE:
Here you are Omkami, thank you. Hello, Mr Akwekwe.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hello, Mr Spare-Buttons-Supplied-With-The-Shirt. Nice to see you again.

ERIC IDLE:
These are some of my fellow explorers: Sir Charles Farquarson, Brian Bailey, Betty Bailey and this is Mr Akwekwe, who started the whole place.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It really is super.

DIRECTION:
who is dressed as a man and has a moustache

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Terrific idea.

MICHAEL PALIN:
May I recommend the alligator purees.

DIRECTION:
Suddenly there is a hideous scream. We see a gorilla tear a man from his table at the back of the restaurant, in front of a tree and drag him back into the jungle. Awful shrieks are heard. Akwekwe runs into the jungle shouting, Terrible sounds of the unseen fight. Thrashing about of bushes in the distance. A shot rings out. Then silence also rings out. Akwekwe emerges, dragging the inert body of the customer whom he puts back in his chair. He slumps forward. Akwekwe comes back to the table in the foreground which has remained in the foreground throughout this preceding shot, with cut ins of the four explorers looking through the menu. Akwekwe has a bloodstained claw mark right across his face and chest and his dicky is torn and bloodstained.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Now then, have you decided?

DIRECTION:
He produces a notepad such as waiters always carry.

ERIC IDLE:
Ye-es ... Well there's two avocado vinaigrette here and what are you going to have Brian?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Er quiche lorraine for me, please.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right, so that's two avocado, one quiche ...

DIRECTION:
Cut to close up of pygmy's evil face parting leaves and firing a blow-pipe. Cut to another table where two explorers are having coffee and cigars. One of them stiffens and then slumps firward. Cut to Akwekwe at the main table registering what has happened. We pan with him as he rushes over to the bushes. Sound of pygmies retreating into the bushes. Akwekwe shouts after him. We pan with Akwekwe as he walks over to the table where the customer has slumped forward. He pulls him up, looks at dart sticking out of his chest, tut tuts with annoyance and lets him slump back on to the table again. He returns to the main table.

MICHAEL PALIN:
So, that's two avocado, one quiche ...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
And a soup of the day.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right.

DIRECTION:
sinister sound of jungle drums in distance; close up of look of fear in Akwekwe's eyes

MICHAEL PALIN:
And to follow?

ERIC IDLE:
Two chicken à la reine, with sauce provençale.

JOHN CLEESE:
And one scampi desirée.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
And boeuf bourguignon with a green salad.

DIRECTION:
Jungle drums getting louder. Akwekwe shouts off towards the back of the clearing where we assume the kitchens mast be.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right on. Two chicken! One scampi! One boeuf with green salad!

DIRECTION:
He casts yet another fearful glance in the direction of the ever-increasing drum beats.

MICHAEL PALIN:
There may be ... a little delay.

ERIC IDLE:
That's fine but we have to be out by three.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, sir. Yes, we'll try.

DIRECTION:
The drum beats get louder. Shot of forest, rustling of bushes. Close up of Akwekwe's eyes. Another shot of forest. Drum beats louder. More rustling. Close up of Akwekwe's eyes and sweating forehead. Forest again and more noise. Close up of Akwekwe; he now has blood on his face, his eyes dilate with fear, the drum beats become deafening. Sudden cut to BBC world symbol.

ERIC IDLE:
The BBC would like to announce that the next scene is not considered suitable for family viewing. It contains scenes of violence, involving people's heads and arms getting chopped off, their ears nailed to trees, and their toenails pulled out in slow motion. There are also scenes of naked women with floppy breasts, and also at one point you can see a pair of buttocks and there's another bit where I'll swear you can see everything, but my friend says it's just the way he's holding the spear.

DIRECTION:
pulling himself together

ERIC IDLE:
Because of the unsuitability of the scene, the BBC will be replacing it with a scene from a repeat of 'Gardening Club' for 1958.

DIRECTION:
A beautiful well-stocked garden bed. 'Gardening Club' music. After two seconds there are shrieks of licentious and lustful laughter. A nude woman pursues a city gent, both screaming with pleasure, into the middle of the flowerbed and they roll around smashing up the flowers in unbridled erotic orgy. Immediately two nuns run in to join the fun, followed by two Vikings, a gumby, a pantomime goose, etc. The whole of this orgy is speeded up.
