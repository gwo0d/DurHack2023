TERRY JONES:
Liberal rubbish. Klaus ...What do you want with your jugged fish?

ERIC IDLE:
Halibut.

TERRY JONES:
The jugged fish is halibut.

ERIC IDLE:
Well, what fish have you got that isn't jugged?

TERRY JONES:
Rabbit.

ERIC IDLE:
What? Rabbit fish?

TERRY JONES:
Yes. It's got fins.

ERIC IDLE:
Is it dead?

TERRY JONES:
Well, it was coughing up blood last night.

ERIC IDLE:
All right I'll have the dead unjugged rabbit fish.

ERIC IDLE:
Well that was really horrible.

TERRY JONES:
You're always complaining.

ERIC IDLE:
What's for afters?

TERRY JONES:
Well there's rat cake ... rat sorbet ... rat pudding ... or strawberry tart.

ERIC IDLE:
Strawberry tart?!

TERRY JONES:
Well, it's got

TERRY JONES:
rat in it.

ERIC IDLE:
How much?

TERRY JONES:
Three (rather a lot really).

ERIC IDLE:
... well, I'll have a slice without so much rat in it.

ERIC IDLE:
Appalling.

TERRY JONES:
Moan, moan, moan.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Hello, mum, hello, dad.

ERIC IDLE:
Hello, son.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
There's a dead bishop on the landing.

TERRY JONES:
Where did that come from?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What do you mean?

TERRY JONES:
What's its diocese?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well it looked a bit Bath and Wellsish to me.

ERIC IDLE:
I'll go and have a look.

TERRY JONES:
I don't know who keeps bringing them in here.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well it's not me.

TERRY JONES:
I've put three out by the bin and the dustmen won't touch 'em.

ERIC IDLE:
Leicester.

TERRY JONES:
How do you know?

ERIC IDLE:
Tattooed on the back of his neck. I'm going to call the police.

TERRY JONES:
Shouldn't you call the Church?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Call the Church police.

ERIC IDLE:
...all right.

ERIC IDLE:
The Church police!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yus?

TERRY JONES:
There's another dead bishop on the landing.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Suffragan or diocesan?

TERRY JONES:
How should I know?

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's tatooed on the back of their neck. Ere! Is that rat tart?

TERRY JONES:
Yes.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Disgusting! Right! The hunt is on.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh Lord we beseech thee tell us who croaked Leicester.

ERIC IDLE:
All right, it's a fair cop, but society is to blame.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Agreed.

ERIC IDLE:
I would like the three by the bin to be taken into consideration.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right. And now, I'd like to conclude this arrest with a hymn.

JOHN CLEESE:
What a simply super little place!

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, they've done wonders with it. You know this used to be one of the most swampy disease infested areas of the whole jungle, and they've turned it into this smashing little restaurant.

ERIC IDLE:
Here you are Omkami, thank you. Hello, Mr Akwekwe.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hello, Mr Spare-Buttons-Supplied-With-The-Shirt. Nice to see you again.

ERIC IDLE:
These are some of my fellow explorers: Sir Charles Farquarson, Brian Bailey, Betty Bailey and this is Mr Akwekwe, who started the whole place.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It really is super.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Terrific idea.

MICHAEL PALIN:
May I recommend the alligator purees.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Now then, have you decided?

ERIC IDLE:
Ye-es ... Well there's two avocado vinaigrette here and what are you going to have Brian?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Er quiche lorraine for me, please.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right, so that's two avocado, one quiche ...

MICHAEL PALIN:
So, that's two avocado, one quiche ...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
And a soup of the day.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And to follow?

ERIC IDLE:
Two chicken à la reine, with sauce provençale.

JOHN CLEESE:
And one scampi desirée.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
And boeuf bourguignon with a green salad.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right on. Two chicken! One scampi! One boeuf with green salad!

MICHAEL PALIN:
There may be ... a little delay.

ERIC IDLE:
That's fine but we have to be out by three.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, sir. Yes, we'll try.

ERIC IDLE:
The BBC would like to announce that the next scene is not considered suitable for family viewing. It contains scenes of violence, involving people's heads and arms getting chopped off, their ears nailed to trees, and their toenails pulled out in slow motion. There are also scenes of naked women with floppy breasts, and also at one point you can see a pair of buttocks and there's another bit where I'll swear you can see everything, but my friend says it's just the way he's holding the spear.

ERIC IDLE:
Because of the unsuitability of the scene, the BBC will be replacing it with a scene from a repeat of 'Gardening Club' for 1958.
