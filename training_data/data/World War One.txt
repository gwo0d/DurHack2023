TERRY JONES:
This is your captain speaking. There is no need for panic. Woman and children first. I repeat that, women and children first.

TERRY JONES:
Do not rush for the lifeboats - remember, women and children first.

JOHN CLEESE:
And Red Indians!

TERRY JONES:
What did you have to get dressed up like that for?

JOHN CLEESE:
It was the only thing left.

TERRY JONES:
Oh. All right.

TERRY JONES:
Women, children and Red Indians...

TERRY GILLIAM:
And spacemen!

TERRY JONES:
Here is a revised list. Women, children, Red Indians and spacemen,

TERRY JONES:
what's that meant to be?

ERIC IDLE:
Well it's a sort of impression of what a kind of Renaissance courtier artist might have looked like at the court of one of the great families like the Medicis or the Borgias...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No it's not, it's more Flemish than Italian.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes - that's a Flemish merchant of the fifteenth or sixteenth centuries...

ERIC IDLE:
What! With these tassles?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, yes. They had those fined doublets going tapering down into the full hose you know - exactly like that.

TERRY JONES:
Now, what is it meant to be? I've got to tell them something. .. is it a Flemish merchant?

ERIC IDLE:
No, it is not a Flemish merchant. It's more a sort of idealized version of the complete Renaissance Man...

TERRY JONES:
Oh, all right.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It's not...

TERRY JONES:
All right! All right!

TERRY JONES:
and a sort of idealized version of complete Renaissance Men first!

ERIC IDLE:
Flemish merchants did not wear hand-embroidered chevrons. They did not!

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, Gomez?

JOHN CLEESE:
You see the BBC has to pay an actor twenty guineas if he speaks and it makes a bit of a hole in the budget...

TERRY GILLIAM:
Twenty-

TERRY GILLIAM:
guineas, sir! Ooh, sorry.

JOHN CLEESE:
You fool Gomez - that's twenty-eight guineas ...

ERIC IDLE:
What about me, sir?

JOHN CLEESE:
Are you supposed to speak?

ERIC IDLE:
No, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
But you've just spoken!

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, sorry, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
You fool, that's, that's fifty-six guineas before we've even started;

JOHN CLEESE:
What did he do that for?

ERIC IDLE:
It's a stunt, sir, an extra twenty guineas.

JOHN CLEESE:
Look! We can't afford it! The BBC are short of money as it is.
