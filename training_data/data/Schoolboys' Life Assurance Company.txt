DIRECTION:
Cut to a headmaster's study.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Knock, enter and approach.

DIRECTION:
knock on door; it opens and three schoolboys in short trousers enter

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right, it's come to my notice that certain boys have been running a unit-trust linked assurance scheme with fringe benefits and full cash-in endowment facilities. Apparently small investors were attracted by the wide-ranging portfolio and that in the first week the limited offer was oversubscribed eight times.

ERIC IDLE:
It was Tidwell's idea, sir.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Shut up, Stebbins! I haven't finished. Oh, by the way, congratulations on winning the Italian Grand Prix at Monza.

ERIC IDLE:
Thank you, sir.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Shut up. Now then, this sort of extra-curricular capitalist expansion has got to stop. I made it quite clear when Potter tried to go public last term, that these massive stock exchange deals must not happen in Big School. Is that clear, Balderston?

TERRY GILLIAM:
Yes, sir.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, and Balderston, next time you do a 'Panorama' Report on the Black Ghettos you

DIRECTION:
must

MICHAEL PALIN:
get an exeat form from Mr Dibley.

TERRY GILLIAM:
Sorry, sir.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Shut up, and stop slouching. Now, the reason I called you in here today, is that my wife is having a little trouble with her,.. er... with her waterworks, and I think she needs a bit of attention. Now, which one of you is the surgeon?

DIRECTION:
silence

DIRECTION:
Tidwell raises hand reluctantly

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah! Tidwell. Good. Well, I want you to come along and have a look at the wife.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, sir! Why don't you ask Stebbins? He's a gynaecologist.

ERIC IDLE:
Ooh! You rotten stinker, Tidwell!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Is this true, Stebbins? Are you a gynaecologist?

DIRECTION:
very reluctantly

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, sir.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right, just the man. How much do you charge?

DIRECTION:
muttering into his shoes

ERIC IDLE:
Thirty guineas, sir.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Excellent. Right. I want you to go along to see the wife. Give her a full examination, and let me know the results by the end of break. And don't pick your nose!
