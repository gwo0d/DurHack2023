MICHAEL PALIN:
Good morning, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
Good Morning. I was sitting in the public library on Thurmon Street just now, skimming through 'Rogue Herries' by Horace Walpole, when suddenly I came over all peckish.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Peckish, sir?

JOHN CLEESE:
Esurient.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Eh?

JOHN CLEESE:
Eee I were all hungry, like!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, hungry.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Come again.

JOHN CLEESE:
I want to buy some cheese.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, I thought you were complaining about the music!

JOHN CLEESE:
Heaven forbid. I am one who delights in all manifestations of the terpsichorean muse.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Sorry?

JOHN CLEESE:
I like a nice dance - you're forced to.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Anyway.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Who said that?

JOHN CLEESE:
Now my good man, some cheese, please.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes certainly, sir. What would you like?

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, how about a little Red Leicester.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'm, afraid we're fresh out of Red Leicester, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, never mind. How are you on Tilsit?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Never at the end of the week, sir. Always get it fresh first thing on Monday.

JOHN CLEESE:
Tish tish. No matter. Well, four ounces of Caerphilly, then, if you please, stout yeoman.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah well, it's been on order for two weeks, sir, I was expecting it this morning.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, it's not my day, is it? Er, Bel Paese?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Sorry.

JOHN CLEESE:
Red Windsor?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Normally, sir, yes, but today the van broke down.

JOHN CLEESE:
Ah. Stilton?

JOHN CLEESE:
Gruyere? Emmental?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No.

JOHN CLEESE:
Any Norwegian Jarlsberger?

JOHN CLEESE:

JOHN CLEESE:

JOHN CLEESE:

JOHN CLEESE:

JOHN CLEESE:
Brie, Roquefort, Pont-l'Évêque, Port Salut, Savoyard, Saint-Paulin, Carre-de-L'Est, Boursin, Bresse-Bleu, Perle de Champagne, Camenbert?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah! We do have some Camembert, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
You do! Excellent.

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's a bit runny, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, I like it runny.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well as a matter of fact it's

MICHAEL PALIN:
runny, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
No matter. No matter. Hand over le fromage de la Belle France qui s'apelle Camembert, s'il vous plaît.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I think it's runnier than you like it, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
I don't care how excrementally runny it is. Hand it over with all speed.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, sir.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh...

JOHN CLEESE:
What?

MICHAEL PALIN:
The cat's eaten it.

JOHN CLEESE:
Has he?

MICHAEL PALIN:
She, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
Gouda?

JOHN CLEESE:
Edam?

JOHN CLEESE:
Caithness?

JOHN CLEESE:
Smoked Austrian?

JOHN CLEESE:
Sage Darby?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
You do have some cheese, do you?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Certainly, sir. It's a cheese shop, sir. We've got...

JOHN CLEESE:
No, no, no, don't tell me. I'm keen to guess.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Fair enough.

JOHN CLEESE:
Wensleydale.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, sir?

JOHN CLEESE:
Splendid. Well, I'll have some of that then, please.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, I'm sorry sir, I thought you were reffering to me, Mr Wensleydale.

JOHN CLEESE:
Gorgonzola?

JOHN CLEESE:

JOHN CLEESE:
Pippo Crème?

JOHN CLEESE:
Any Danish Fynbo?

JOHN CLEESE:
Czechoslovakian Sheep's Milk Cheese?

JOHN CLEESE:
Venezuelan Beaver Cheese?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Not today sir, no.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well let's keep it simple, how about Cheddar?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, I'm afraid we don't get much call for it around these parts.

JOHN CLEESE:
Not call for it? It's the single most popular cheese in the world!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Not round these parts, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
And pray what is the most popular cheese round these parts?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ilchester, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
I see.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, sir. It's quite staggeringly popular in the manor, squire.

JOHN CLEESE:
Is it.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes sir, it's our number-one seller.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
Ilchester, eh?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right.

JOHN CLEESE:
OK, I'm game. Have you got any, he asked, expecting the answer no?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'll have a look, sir...nnnnnnooooooooo.

JOHN CLEESE:
It's not much of a cheese shop really, is it?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Finest in the district, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
And what leads you to that conclusion?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, it's so clean.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, it's certainly uncontaminated by cheese.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You haven't asked me about Limberger, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
Is it worth it?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Could be.

JOHN CLEESE:
OK, have you...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Told you so.

JOHN CLEESE:
Have you got any Limberger?

JOHN CLEESE:
No, that figures. It was pretty predictable, really. It was an act of purest optimism to pose the question in the first place. Tell me something, do you have any cheese at all?

JOHN CLEESE:
Now I'm going to ask you that question once more, and if you say 'no' I'm going to shoot you through the head. Now, do you have any cheese at all?

JOHN CLEESE:
What a senseless waste of human life.
