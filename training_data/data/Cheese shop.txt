A montage of photographs. The cutting from photo to photo is pretty fast. Greek music is heard. Starting with: a close up of Mousebender, who is respectable and wears smart casual clothes; various photos of Mousebender walking along the pavement, again very artily shot from show-off angles; Mousebender pausing outside a shop; Mousebender looking up at the shop; Edwardian-style shop with large sign above it reading 'Ye Olde Cheese Emporium'; another sign below the first reading 'Henry Wensleydale, Purveyor of Fine Cheese to the Gentry and the Poverty Stricken Too'; another sign below this reading 'Licensed for Public Dancing'; close up of Mousebender looking pleased; shot of Mousebender entering the shop. Music cuts dead. Cut to interior of the cheese shop. Greek music playing as Mousebender enters. Two men dressed as city gents are Greek dancing in the corner to the music of a bouzouki. The shop itself is large and redolent of the charm and languidity of a bygone age. There is actually no cheese to be seen either on or behind the counter but this is not obvious. Mousebender approaches the counter and rings a small handbell. Wensleydale appears.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good morning, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
Good Morning. I was sitting in the public library on Thurmon Street just now, skimming through 'Rogue Herries' by Horace Walpole, when suddenly I came over all peckish.

MICHAEL PALIN:

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, I thought you were complaining about the music!

JOHN CLEESE:

JOHN CLEESE:
Now my good man, some cheese, please.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes certainly, sir. What would you like?

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, how about a little Red Leicester.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'm, afraid we're fresh out of Red Leicester, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, never mind. How are you on Tilsit?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Never at the end of the week, sir. Always get it fresh first thing on Monday.

JOHN CLEESE:
Tish tish. No matter. Well, four ounces of Caerphilly, then, if you please, stout yeoman.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah well, it's been on order for two weeks, sir, I was expecting it this morning.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, it's not my day, is it? Er, Bel Paese?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Sorry.

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's a bit runny, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, I like it runny.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well as a matter of fact it's

DIRECTION:
very

MICHAEL PALIN:
runny, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
No matter. No matter. Hand over le fromage de la Belle France qui s'apelle Camembert, s'il vous plaît.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I think it's runnier than you like it, sir.

DIRECTION:

MICHAEL PALIN:
Certainly, sir. It's a cheese shop, sir. We've got...

JOHN CLEESE:
No, no, no, don't tell me. I'm keen to guess.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Fair enough.

JOHN CLEESE:
Wensleydale.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, sir?

JOHN CLEESE:
Splendid. Well, I'll have some of that then, please.

DIRECTION:
pause

JOHN CLEESE:
Well let's keep it simple, how about Cheddar?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, I'm afraid we don't get much call for it around these parts.

JOHN CLEESE:
Not call for it? It's the single most popular cheese in the world!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Not round these parts, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
And pray what is the most popular cheese round these parts?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ilchester, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
I see.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, sir. It's quite staggeringly popular in the manor, squire.

JOHN CLEESE:
Is it.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes sir, it's our number-one seller.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
Ilchester, eh?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right.

JOHN CLEESE:
OK, I'm game. Have you got any, he asked, expecting the answer no?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'll have a look, sir...nnnnnnooooooooo.

JOHN CLEESE:
It's not much of a cheese shop really, is it?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Finest in the district, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
And what leads you to that conclusion?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, it's so clean.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, it's certainly uncontaminated by cheese.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You haven't asked me about Limberger, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
Is it worth it?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Could be.

JOHN CLEESE:
OK, have you...

DIRECTION:
will you shut that bloody dancing up!

DIRECTION:
the music stops

DIRECTION:
to dancers

MICHAEL PALIN:
Told you so.

JOHN CLEESE:
Have you got any Limberger?

JOHN CLEESE:
No, that figures. It was pretty predictable, really. It was an act of purest optimism to pose the question in the first place. Tell me something, do you have any cheese at all?

JOHN CLEESE:
Now I'm going to ask you that question once more, and if you say 'no' I'm going to shoot you through the head. Now, do you have any cheese at all?

DIRECTION:
shoots him

JOHN CLEESE:
What a senseless waste of human life.

DIRECTION:
Mousebender puts a cowboy hat on his head. Cut to stock shot of man on horse riding into the sunset. Music swells dramatically.
