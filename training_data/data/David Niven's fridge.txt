ERIC IDLE:
Ladies and gentlemen, seldom can it have been a greater pleasure and privilege than it is for me now to announce that the next award gave me the great pleasure and privilege of asking a man without whose ceaseless energy and tireless skill the British Film Indusrty would be today. I refer of course to my friend and colleague, Mr David Niven.

DIRECTION:
vast applause, a bit of emotion from Dickie

DIRECTION:
applause; 'Around the world in eighty days' music; the fridge is pushed down by a man in a brown coat

ERIC IDLE:
This is the fridge in which David keeps most of his milk, butter and eggs. What a typically selfless gesture, that he should send this fridge, of all his fridges, to be with us tonight.

DIRECTION:
the same silly voice

DIRECTION:
The nominations for the best Foreign Film Director are: Monsieur Richad Attenborough, Ricardo de Attenbergie, Rik Artenborough, Ri Char Dat En Bollo, and Pier Paolo Pasolini.
