ERIC IDLE:
Good evening and welcome to 'Nationwide'. The programme where we do rather wet things nationally and also give you the chance to see some rather wet items in the Regions. Well, everyone is talking about the Third World War which broke out this morning. But here on 'Nationwide' we're going to get away from that a bit and look instead at the latest theory that sitting down regularly in a comfortable chair can rest your legs. It sounds very nice doesn't it, but can it be done? Is it possible or practical for many of us in our jobs and with the sort of busy lives we lead to sit down in a comfortable chair just when we want? We sent our reporter John Dull to find out.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, here I am on London's busy Westminster Bridge, seeing just how much time sitting down can take. Well, I arrived here by train at about 8:50, it's now 9:05, so I've been here approximately twelve minutes and if it's any encouragement, I must say that my legs do feel rested.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Is this your chair?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Er ... well, no, it's a prop.

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's been stolen!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What?

MICHAEL PALIN:
This belongs to a Mrs Edgeworth of Pinner - she's standing over there.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ah well, it's nothing to do with me. It's just a prop which the BBC ... aaargh!

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's got her name on the bottom.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well er ... perhaps you'd better give it back to her.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You don't believe I'm a policeman, do you?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes I do!
