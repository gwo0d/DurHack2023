Cut to Dull sitting in a chair on Westminster Bridge.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, here I am on London's busy Westminster Bridge, seeing just how much time sitting down can take. Well, I arrived here by train at about 8:50, it's now 9:05, so I've been here approximately twelve minutes and if it's any encouragement, I must say that my legs do feel rested.

DIRECTION:
A policeman walks up to him.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Is this your chair?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Er ... well, no, it's a prop.

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's been stolen!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What?

MICHAEL PALIN:
This belongs to a Mrs Edgeworth of Pinner - she's standing over there.

DIRECTION:
Cut to worried middle-aged lady, standing on the other side of the road, peering across. She has an identical chair in one hand.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ah well, it's nothing to do with me. It's just a prop which the BBC ... aaargh!

The policeman pushes the reporter off and picks up the chair.

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's got her name on the bottom.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well er ... perhaps you'd better give it back to her.

You don't believe I'm a policeman, do you?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes I do!
