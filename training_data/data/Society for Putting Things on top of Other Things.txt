DIRECTION:
Cut to a hallway in which a middle-aged man in dinner dress is putting down the telephone rather furtively. He leaves the booth and goes through a door into a large room where a banquet is in progress. There are tables on three sides of a square and he joins the head table which faces as it were downstage. He sits beside other middle-aged and rather elderly men all of whom are the city of London ex-public school type. As he sits, the toastmaster standing behind speaks.

TERRY JONES:
Sorry chaps, it was my mother.

ERIC IDLE:
Gentlemen, pray silence for the President of the Royal Society for Putting Things on Top of Other Things.

DIRECTION:
There is much upperclass applause and banging on the table as Sir William rises to his feet.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I thank you, gentlemen. The year has been a good one for the Society

DIRECTION:
hear, hear

DIRECTION:
not

DIRECTION:
shame!

DIRECTION:
applause

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
. Therefore I call upon our Staffordshire delegate to explain this weird behaviour.

DIRECTION:
As Sir William sits a meek man rises at one of the side tables.

JOHN CLEESE:
Er, Cutler, Staffordshire. Um ... well, Mr Chairman, it's just that most of the members in Staffordshire feel... the whole thing's a bit silly.

DIRECTION:
Cries of outrage. Chairman leaps to feet.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Silly! SILLY!!

DIRECTION:
he pauses and thinks

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Right, okay, meeting adjourned for ever.

DIRECTION:
He gets right up and walks away from the table to approving noises and applause. He walks to a door at the side of the studio set and goes through it. Exterior shot: a door opens and Sir William appears out of it into the fresh air. He suddenly halts.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Good Lord. I'm on film. How did that happen?

DIRECTION:
He turns round and disappears into the building again. He reappears through door, crosses set and goes out through another door. He appears from the door into the fresh air and then stops.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It's film again. What's going on?

DIRECTION:
He turns and disappears through the door again. Cut to him inside the building. He crosses to a window and looks out, then turns and says...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Gentlemen! I have bad news. This room is surrounded by film.

DIRECTION:
What? What?

DIRECTION:
Several members run to window and look out. Cut to film of them looking out of mindow. Cut to studio: the members run to a door and open it. Cut to film: of them appearing at the door hesitating and then closing door. Cut to studio: with increasing panic they run to the second door. Cut to film: they appear, hesitate, and go back inside. Cut to studio: they run to Sir William in the centre of the room.

TERRY JONES:
We're trapped!
