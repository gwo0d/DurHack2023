TERRY JONES:
Sorry chaps, it was my mother.

ERIC IDLE:
Gentlemen, pray silence for the President of the Royal Society for Putting Things on Top of Other Things.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I thank you, gentlemen. The year has been a good one for the Society

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
. Therefore I call upon our Staffordshire delegate to explain this weird behaviour.

JOHN CLEESE:
Er, Cutler, Staffordshire. Um ... well, Mr Chairman, it's just that most of the members in Staffordshire feel... the whole thing's a bit silly.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Silly! SILLY!!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Right, okay, meeting adjourned for ever.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Good Lord. I'm on film. How did that happen?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It's film again. What's going on?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Gentlemen! I have bad news. This room is surrounded by film.

TERRY JONES:
We're trapped!
