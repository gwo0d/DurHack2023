JOHN CLEESE:
You know I really enjoy interviewing applicants for this management training course.

JOHN CLEESE:
Ah. Come and sit down.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Thank you.

JOHN CLEESE:
Take a seat.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'm sorry.

JOHN CLEESE:
Good morning.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Good morning.

JOHN CLEESE:
Tell me why did you say 'good morning' when you know perfectly well that it's afternoon?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, well, you said 'good morning'. Ha, ha.

JOHN CLEESE:
Good afternoon.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ah, good afternoon.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh dear.

JOHN CLEESE:
Good evening.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
... Goodbye?

JOHN CLEESE:
Ha, ha. No.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Er why did you ring the bell?

JOHN CLEESE:
Why do you think I rang the bell?

JOHN CLEESE:
Five, four, three, two, one, zero!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, I, I...

JOHN CLEESE:
Too late!

JOHN CLEESE:
Goodnight, ding-ding-ding-ding-ding. Goodnight. Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Um. Oh this is, is the interview for the management training course is it?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes. Yes it is. Goodnight. Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh. Oh dear, I don't think I'm doing very well.

JOHN CLEESE:
Why do you say that?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well I don't know.

JOHN CLEESE:
Do you say it because you didn't know?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well. I, I, I, I don't know.

JOHN CLEESE:
Five, four, three, two, one, zero! Right!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well why do you think I did that then?

JOHN CLEESE:
Aren't you curious?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well yes.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, why didn't you ask me?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well...I...er...

JOHN CLEESE:
Name?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What?

JOHN CLEESE:
Your name man, your name!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Um, er David.

JOHN CLEESE:

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh yes.

JOHN CLEESE:

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no Thomas.

JOHN CLEESE:

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no, David Thomas.

JOHN CLEESE:
Goodnight. Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding- ding-ding-ding. Goodnight. Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh dear we're back to that again. I don't know what to do when you do that.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well do something. Goodnight. Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding, five, four, three, two, one . . .

JOHN CLEESE:
Good!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Good?

JOHN CLEESE:
Very good - do it again.

JOHN CLEESE:
Goodnight, ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What's going on? What's going on?

JOHN CLEESE:
You've got very good marks.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well I don't care, I want to know what's going on! I think you're deliberately trying to humiliate people, and I'm going straight out of here and I'm going to tell the police exactly what you do to people and I'm going to make bloody sure that you never do it again. There, what do you think of that? What do you think of that?

JOHN CLEESE:
good marks.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, oh well, do I get the job?

JOHN CLEESE:
Er, well, I'm afraid not. I'm afraid all the vacancies were filled several weeks ago.
