MICHAEL PALIN:
But even more modern building techniques are being used on an expanding new town site near Peterborough; here the Amazing Mystico and Janet can put up a block of flats by hypnosis in under a minute.

MICHAEL PALIN:
The local Council here have over fifty hypnosis-induced twenty-five story blocks, put up by El Mystico and Janet. I asked Mr Ken Verybigliar the advantages of hypnosis compared to other building methods.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well there is a considerable financial advantage in using the services of El Mystico. A block, like Mystico Point here,

MICHAEL PALIN:
would normally cost in the region of one-and-a-half million pounds. This was put up for five pounds and thirty bob for Janet.

MICHAEL PALIN:
But the obvious question is are they safe?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Of course they're safe. There's absolutely no doubt about that. They are as strong, solid and as safe as any other building method in this country provided of course people believe in them.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, we received a note from the Council saying that if we ceased to believe in this building it would fall down.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You don't mind living in a figment of another man's imagination?

ERIC IDLE:
No, it's much better than where we used to live.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Where did you used to live?

ERIC IDLE:
We had an eighteen-roomed villa overlooking Nice.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Really, that sounds much better.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh yes - yes you're right.

ERIC IDLE:
No, no, no, of course not.

ERIC IDLE:
Phew, that was close.

MICHAEL PALIN:
But the construction of these vast new housing developments, providing homes for many thousands of people, is not the only project to which he has applied his many talents. He also has an Infallible Pools Method, a School of Spanish Dancing and a Car Hire Service.

MICHAEL PALIN:
So Mystico has his Janet.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes. Janet ... a quiet, shy girl. An honours graduate from Harvard University, American junior sprint record holder, ex-world skating champion, Nobel Prize winner, architect, novelist and surgeon. The girl who helped crack the Oppenheimer spy ring in 1947. She gave vital evidence to the Senate Narcotics Commission in 1958. She also helped to convict the woman at the chemist's in 1961, and a year later

MICHAEL PALIN:
was electrocuted for shouting in the corridor.
