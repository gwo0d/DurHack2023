MICHAEL PALIN:
But even more modern building techniques are being used on an expanding new town site near Peterborough; here the Amazing Mystico and Janet can put up a block of flats by hypnosis in under a minute.

DIRECTION:
Mystico removes his cloak, gloves and top hat and hands them to Janet, who curtsies. He then makes several passes. Cut to stock film of flats falling down reversed so that they leap up. Cut back to Mystico and Janet. She hands him back his things as they make their way to their car, a little Austin 30.

MICHAEL PALIN:
The local Council here have over fifty hypnosis-induced twenty-five story blocks, put up by El Mystico and Janet. I asked Mr Ken Verybigliar the advantages of hypnosis compared to other building methods.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a man in a drab suit.

SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'MR K. V. B. LIAR'

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well there is a considerable financial advantage in using the services of El Mystico. A block, like Mystico Point here,

indicating a high-rise block behind him

MICHAEL PALIN:
would normally cost in the region of one-and-a-half million pounds. This was put up for five pounds and thirty bob for Janet.

MICHAEL PALIN:
But the obvious question is are they safe?

DIRECTION:
Cut to an architect's office. The architect at his desk. Behind him on the wall are framed photos of various collapsed buildings. He is a well-dressed authoritative person.

DIRECTION:
SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'MR CLEMENT ONAN, ARCHITECT TO THE COUNCIL'

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Of course they're safe. There's absolutely no doubt about that. They are as strong, solid and as safe as any other building method in this country provided of course people believe in them.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a council flat. On the wall there is a picture of Mystico.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, we received a note from the Council saying that if we ceased to believe in this building it would fall down.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You don't mind living in a figment of another man's imagination?

ERIC IDLE:
No, it's much better than where we used to live.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Where did you used to live?

ERIC IDLE:
We had an eighteen-roomed villa overlooking Nice.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Really, that sounds much better.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh yes - yes you're right.

DIRECTION:
Cut to stock shot of block falling down in slow motion. Cut back to tenant and wife inside. Camera shaking and on the tilt.

ERIC IDLE:
No, no, no, of course not.

DIRECTION:
Cut to stock film again. The building rights itself. Cut back to interior again. Camera slightly on tilt. They are holding bits of crockery etc.

ERIC IDLE:
Phew, that was close.

DIRECTION:
Cut to tracking shot from back of camera car again. This time El Mystico striding through the towering blocks, his cloak swirling behind him.

MICHAEL PALIN:
But the construction of these vast new housing developments, providing homes for many thousands of people, is not the only project to which he has applied his many talents. He also has an Infallible Pools Method, a School of Spanish Dancing and a Car Hire Service.

DIRECTION:
cut to Mystico at wheel of his little Austin 30, his amazing eyes riveted on the road ahead; Janet occasiona1ly tactfully guides the steering wheel

So Mystico has his Janet.

Cut to montage of black and white photos of Janet in various stage poses: three poses against black drapes; one against a building; one posed outside a terrace house with notice reading 'School of Spanish Dancing - Dentures Repaired'.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes. Janet ... a quiet, shy girl. An honours graduate from Harvard University, American junior sprint record holder, ex-world skating champion, Nobel Prize winner, architect, novelist and surgeon. The girl who helped crack the Oppenheimer spy ring in 1947. She gave vital evidence to the Senate Narcotics Commission in 1958.
