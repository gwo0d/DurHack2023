ERIC IDLE:
Pratt... back to Pratt... Pratt again... a long ball out to Pratt... and now Pratt is on the ball, a neat little flick back inside to Pratt, who takes it nicely and sends it through on the far side to Pratt, Pratt with it but passes instead to Pratt, Pratt again, oh and well intercepted by the swarthy little number nine, Concito Maracon. This twenty-one-year-old half back, remarkably stocky for 6' 3", square shouldered, balding giant, hair flowing in the wind, bright eyed, pert, young for his age but oh so old in so many ways. For a thirty-nine.year-old you wouldn't expect such speed. Normally considered slow, he's incredibly fast as he wanders aimlessly around, sweeping up and taking the defence to the cleaners. Who would have thought, though many expected it, that this remarkable forty-five-year-old, 9' 4" dwarf of a man, who is still only seventeen in some parts of the world, would ever really be ... Oh and there was a goal there apparently ... and now it's Pratt ... back to Pratt... Pratt again... a long ball to Pratt...

DIRECTION:
crackle

DIRECTION:
By now mother has succeeded in flattening the radio with the iron. She folds it neatly and puts it on the pile.

TERRY JONES:
I like this Ano-Weet, it really unclogs me.

DIRECTION:
Ralph Garibaldi knocks a bowl onto the floor. It smashes.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, do be careful.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Sorry, mum.

DIRECTION:
Kevin opens another can of beans and pours them on to his plate, throwing the tin on the floor. The radio drones on.

TERRY JONES:
I mean a lot of others say they unclog you, but I never had a single bowel movement with the 'Recto-Puffs'.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Now if we ...

DIRECTION:
he knocks the cereal box off the table

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, sorry, mum ... Now if we lived in Rhodesia there'd be someone to mop that up for you.

DIRECTION:
turning from the mirror in mid make-up

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Don't be so bleedin' stupid. If you lived in bleedin' Rhodesia, you'd be out at bleedin' fascist rallies every bleedin' day. You're a bleedin' racist, you bleedin' are.

TERRY JONES:
Language!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well he gets on my sodding wick.

TERRY JONES:
That's better.

DIRECTION:
Mother is now ironing the telephone and the cat. She irons them flat and pins them on the line.

TERRY JONES:
No, the stuff I liked was that stuff they gave us before the war, what was it - Wilkinson's Number 8 Laxative Cereal. Phew. That one went through you like a bloody Ferrari...

DIRECTION:
The doorbell rings.

ERIC IDLE:
Now, who's that at this time of day...

DIRECTION:
she goes out

TERRY JONES:
If it's the man to empty the Elsan, tell him it's in the hall.

ERIC IDLE:
Right, dear.

TERRY JONES:
And make sure that you hold it the right way up!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Dad... ?

DIRECTION:
A middle-aged man appears from the broom cupboard.

DIRECTION:
Yeah?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No no, my dad...

DIRECTION:
Oh...

DIRECTION:
he gets back into the cupboard again

MICHAEL PALIN:
Dad? Why is Rhodesia called Rhodesia?...

DIRECTION:
he knocks the teapot on to the floor, it smashes

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh sorry, dad.

DIRECTION:
Cut to the doorway in the hall. A man in a dark suit, very smart and well-dressed, is doing strange kung-fu antics.

ERIC IDLE:
No... no, really, thank you very much... no, thank you for calling, not today, thank you. Good morning.

DIRECTION:
She shuts the door on him. As she does so Mr Garibaldi shouts out to her.

TERRY JONES:
Who was that?

DIRECTION:
coming in again

DIRECTION:
now

ERIC IDLE:
?

DIRECTION:
he is standing beside the sink which has just split in two

MICHAEL PALIN:
I was just washing up...

ERIC IDLE:
Go and sit down!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Mum? Do you know why Rhodesia's called Rhodesia?

TERRY JONES:
Do you remember 'Go-Eazi'? They were hopeless...

DIRECTION:
Kevin opens another can of beans; dad notices in disgust and flaps his paper again

TERRY JONES:
little black pellets... tasted foul and stuck inside you like flooring adhesive.

DIRECTION:
she has finally finished her startling make-up

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Right, I'm off.

ERIC IDLE:
When are you coming back tonight?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
3 a.m.

ERIC IDLE:
I think it's disgusting... you a Member of Parliament.

TERRY JONES:
I heard you in the hall last night, snogging away.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I wasn't

DIRECTION:
snogging

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
!

TERRY JONES:
Sounded like snogging to me. I could hear his great wet slobbering lips going at yer ... and his hand going up yer...

ERIC IDLE:
Dad!

DIRECTION:
coming out of the cupboard

DIRECTION:
Yes.

ERIC IDLE:
No ... not you.

DIRECTION:
Oh!

DIRECTION:
he goes back in again

ERIC IDLE:
Just mind your language...

DIRECTION:
Ralph knock a leg off the table. It collapses entirely.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, sorry, mum.

DIRECTION:
too fat and flatulent to get up

TERRY GILLIAM:
I've run out of beans!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
We was talking, we was not snogging.

TERRY JONES:
Talking about snogging, I'll bet...

DIRECTION:
The phone rings. Mrs Garibaldi answers it.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
If you must know, we was talking about Council re-housing.

DIRECTION:
on the phone

ERIC IDLE:
Would it mean going to live in Hollywood?

DIRECTION:
desperate but unable to move

TERRY GILLIAM:
I run out of beans!

TERRY JONES:
Where to re-house his right hand, that's what he was interested in!

ERIC IDLE:
And has Faye Dunaway definitely said yes?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
He is the Chairman of the Housing sub-committee.

DIRECTION:
The bell rings.

TERRY JONES:
Snogging sub-committee, more like...

ERIC IDLE:
Ralph, do answer that door will you!

TERRY GILLIAM:
Beans!!

ERIC IDLE:
Shut up!!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yea, mum.

DIRECTION:
shouting to Ralph

TERRY JONES:
If it's the man from the Probbo-Rib, tell him it's in the bed.

DIRECTION:
Ralph gets up. As he goes he knocks the leg off the old-fashioned gas cooker. It falls to one side bringing down shelves next to it, plates, crockery and a section of the wall revealing the hallway the other side.

DIRECTION:
roaring

TERRY GILLIAM:
Beans! Beans!

ERIC IDLE:
Shut up!

DIRECTION:
A man in a Tarzan outfit, except with a postman's hat and a little mailbag, swings in on a liana shouting a jungle yell.

DIRECTION:
Postman-a-a-n!!

DIRECTION:
A gong sounds. They all stop acting.

DIRECTION:
Cut to stock film of ladies applauding.

DIRECTION:
Pull out from this stock film to see that it is on a screen in a presentation studio. A glittery compère is also applauding sycophantically at his desk, about which is the glittery slogan 'Most Awful Family in Britain, 1974. Sponsored by Heart Attacko Margarine'.

MICHAEL PALIN:
A very good try there, by the Garibaldi family of Droitwich in Worcestershire. Professor...

DIRECTION:
Pull out further to pick up a panel of three distinguished rather academic looking people.

ERIC IDLE:
Well, I can't make up my mind about this family... I don't think there was the sustained awfulness that we really need. I mean, the father was appalling...

DIRECTION:
Two other members of the panel nod vigorous agreement.

TERRY JONES:
Appalling... yes ....

ERIC IDLE:
He was dirty, smelly and distasteful ... and I liked him very much ... but...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Lady Organs?

TERRY JONES:
Well ... they were an unpleasant family certainly, but I don't think we had enough of the really gross awfulness that we're looking for...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, harsh words there for the Garibaldi family of Droitwich in Worcestershire, at present holders of the East Midlands Most Awful Family Award - Lower Middle-Class Section but unable today to score more than fifteen on our disgustometer. Well with the scores all in from the judges, the Garibaldis are number three ... and a surprise number two ... the Fanshaw-Chumleighs of Berkshire...

DIRECTION:
he turns to the screen

DIRECTION:
A very elegant breakfast table in beautifully tasteful surroundings. Four upper-class folk - two woman (Michael and Graham) and two men (Eric and Terry J) - are talking most incredibly loudly at each other, with quite appalling accents. An appalling din altogether. They talk just about at the same time as each other.

ERIC IDLE:
What a super meal.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Absolutely super. Pat and Max are coming down from Eton to help daddy count money.

TERRY JONES:
How absolutely super.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
My man at Poirer's says I could have my whole body lifted for £5,500

ERIC IDLE:
How super...

DIRECTION:
etc.

DIRECTION:
Cut back to the panel nodding thoughfully.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, some of the wonderful behaviour that made the Fanshaw-Chumleighs the second Most Awful Family in Britain 1974. But the winners, by a clear ten point margin, are once again the awful Jodrell family of Durham. Unfortunately, we're not allowed to show you some of the performance that won them an award, but I assure you it was of the very highest standard, was it not, Lady Organs?

TERRY JONES:
Oh, yes, superb ... Mr Jodrell - you know, the old grandfather, who licks the ...

DIRECTION:
hurriedly

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, yes...

TERRY JONES:
He's superb. His gobbing is consistent and accurate. His son is a dirty foul little creature, and those frightful scabs which Mrs Jodrell licks off the cat are...

DIRECTION:
during this speech we cut to the same image on a TV screen

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, thank you very much, Lady Organs ... and from all of us all, well done to the Jodrells ... and to all of you, not forgetting those of you who may be halfway in between, without whom, of course, and not forgetting who made it all possible, when, and we'll be back, until then and so it's goodnight from me and here's wishing you a safe journey home, thank you for watching this show, don't forget it was all great fun, I've enjoyed it, and I hope you watching at home have enjoyed it too.

DIRECTION:
He is switched off, and fades into a dot. Pull back to reveal that the TV which has just been switched off is in a dirty old sitting room in which all the characters are really unpleaant pepperpots. They are dressed more or less identically, except that son has a school cap and a blazer over his pepperpot gear. He has a satchel and National Health glasses. The father has moustache and glasses and a Fair-Isle jersey.

ERIC IDLE:
The Jodrells win every bloody year... makes you vomit ... dad?

TERRY JONES:
Yes?

ERIC IDLE:
Get your stinking feet off the bread.

TERRY JONES:
I'm only wiping the cat's do's off.

TERRY GILLIAM:
Mum?

ERIC IDLE:
Shut yet face, Douglas.

TERRY GILLIAM:
I wanted some corn-plasters.

ERIC IDLE:
Shut up and eat what you got.

DIRECTION:
A cat set into the wall, i.e. a glove puppet, screeches as if someone had pulled its tail outside.

TERRY JONES:
Some fat bastard at the door!

DIRECTION:
to the cat

DIRECTION:
she slaps it; it expires
