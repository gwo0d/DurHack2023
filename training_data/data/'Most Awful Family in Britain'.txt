ERIC IDLE:
Pratt... back to Pratt... Pratt again... a long ball out to Pratt... and now Pratt is on the ball, a neat little flick back inside to Pratt, who takes it nicely and sends it through on the far side to Pratt, Pratt with it but passes instead to Pratt, Pratt again, oh and well intercepted by the swarthy little number nine, Concito Maracon. This twenty-one-year-old half back, remarkably stocky for 6' 3", square shouldered, balding giant, hair flowing in the wind, bright eyed, pert, young for his age but oh so old in so many ways. For a thirty-nine.year-old you wouldn't expect such speed. Normally considered slow, he's incredibly fast as he wanders aimlessly around, sweeping up and taking the defence to the cleaners. Who would have thought, though many expected it, that this remarkable forty-five-year-old, 9' 4" dwarf of a man, who is still only seventeen in some parts of the world, would ever really be ... Oh and there was a goal there apparently ... and now it's Pratt ... back to Pratt... Pratt again... a long ball to Pratt...

TERRY JONES:
I like this Ano-Weet, it really unclogs me.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, do be careful.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Sorry, mum.

TERRY JONES:
I mean a lot of others say they unclog you, but I never had a single bowel movement with the 'Recto-Puffs'.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Now if we ...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, sorry, mum ... Now if we lived in Rhodesia there'd be someone to mop that up for you.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Don't be so bleedin' stupid. If you lived in bleedin' Rhodesia, you'd be out at bleedin' fascist rallies every bleedin' day. You're a bleedin' racist, you bleedin' are.

TERRY JONES:
Language!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well he gets on my sodding wick.

TERRY JONES:
That's better.

TERRY JONES:
No, the stuff I liked was that stuff they gave us before the war, what was it - Wilkinson's Number 8 Laxative Cereal. Phew. That one went through you like a bloody Ferrari...

ERIC IDLE:
Now, who's that at this time of day...

TERRY JONES:
If it's the man to empty the Elsan, tell him it's in the hall.

ERIC IDLE:
Right, dear.

TERRY JONES:
And make sure that you hold it the right way up!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Dad... ?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No no, my dad...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Dad? Why is Rhodesia called Rhodesia?...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh sorry, dad.

ERIC IDLE:
No... no, really, thank you very much... no, thank you for calling, not today, thank you. Good morning.

TERRY JONES:
Who was that?

ERIC IDLE:
?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I was just washing up...

ERIC IDLE:
Go and sit down!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Mum? Do you know why Rhodesia's called Rhodesia?

TERRY JONES:
Do you remember 'Go-Eazi'? They were hopeless...

TERRY JONES:
little black pellets... tasted foul and stuck inside you like flooring adhesive.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Right, I'm off.

ERIC IDLE:
When are you coming back tonight?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
3 a.m.

ERIC IDLE:
I think it's disgusting... you a Member of Parliament.

TERRY JONES:
I heard you in the hall last night, snogging away.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I wasn't

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
!

TERRY JONES:
Sounded like snogging to me. I could hear his great wet slobbering lips going at yer ... and his hand going up yer...

ERIC IDLE:
Dad!

ERIC IDLE:
No ... not you.

ERIC IDLE:
Just mind your language...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, sorry, mum.

TERRY GILLIAM:
I've run out of beans!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
We was talking, we was not snogging.

TERRY JONES:
Talking about snogging, I'll bet...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
If you must know, we was talking about Council re-housing.

ERIC IDLE:
Would it mean going to live in Hollywood?

TERRY GILLIAM:
I run out of beans!

TERRY JONES:
Where to re-house his right hand, that's what he was interested in!

ERIC IDLE:
And has Faye Dunaway definitely said yes?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
He is the Chairman of the Housing sub-committee.

TERRY JONES:
Snogging sub-committee, more like...

ERIC IDLE:
Ralph, do answer that door will you!

TERRY GILLIAM:
Beans!!

ERIC IDLE:
Shut up!!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yea, mum.

TERRY JONES:
If it's the man from the Probbo-Rib, tell him it's in the bed.

TERRY GILLIAM:
Beans! Beans!

ERIC IDLE:
Shut up!

MICHAEL PALIN:
A very good try there, by the Garibaldi family of Droitwich in Worcestershire. Professor...

ERIC IDLE:
Well, I can't make up my mind about this family... I don't think there was the sustained awfulness that we really need. I mean, the father was appalling...

TERRY JONES:
Appalling... yes ....

ERIC IDLE:
He was dirty, smelly and distasteful ... and I liked him very much ... but...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Lady Organs?

TERRY JONES:
Well ... they were an unpleasant family certainly, but I don't think we had enough of the really gross awfulness that we're looking for...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, harsh words there for the Garibaldi family of Droitwich in Worcestershire, at present holders of the East Midlands Most Awful Family Award - Lower Middle-Class Section but unable today to score more than fifteen on our disgustometer. Well with the scores all in from the judges, the Garibaldis are number three ... and a surprise number two ... the Fanshaw-Chumleighs of Berkshire...

ERIC IDLE:
What a super meal.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Absolutely super. Pat and Max are coming down from Eton to help daddy count money.

TERRY JONES:
How absolutely super.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
My man at Poirer's says I could have my whole body lifted for Â£5,500

ERIC IDLE:
How super...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, some of the wonderful behaviour that made the Fanshaw-Chumleighs the second Most Awful Family in Britain 1974. But the winners, by a clear ten point margin, are once again the awful Jodrell family of Durham. Unfortunately, we're not allowed to show you some of the performance that won them an award, but I assure you it was of the very highest standard, was it not, Lady Organs?

TERRY JONES:
Oh, yes, superb ... Mr Jodrell - you know, the old grandfather, who licks the ...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, yes...

TERRY JONES:
He's superb. His gobbing is consistent and accurate. His son is a dirty foul little creature, and those frightful scabs which Mrs Jodrell licks off the cat are...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, thank you very much, Lady Organs ... and from all of us all, well done to the Jodrells ... and to all of you, not forgetting those of you who may be halfway in between, without whom, of course, and not forgetting who made it all possible, when, and we'll be back, until then and so it's goodnight from me and here's wishing you a safe journey home, thank you for watching this show, don't forget it was all great fun, I've enjoyed it, and I hope you watching at home have enjoyed it too.

ERIC IDLE:
The Jodrells win every bloody year... makes you vomit ... dad?

TERRY JONES:
Yes?

ERIC IDLE:
Get your stinking feet off the bread.

TERRY JONES:
I'm only wiping the cat's do's off.

TERRY GILLIAM:
Mum?

ERIC IDLE:
Shut yet face, Douglas.

TERRY GILLIAM:
I wanted some corn-plasters.

ERIC IDLE:
Shut up and eat what you got.

TERRY JONES:
Some fat bastard at the door!
