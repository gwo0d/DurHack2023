ERIC IDLE:
This man is Ernest Scribbler... writer of jokes. In a few moments, he will have written the funniest joke in the world... and, as a consequence, he will die ... laughing.

DIRECTION:
Ernest stops writing, pauses to look at what he has written... a smile slowly spreads across his face, turning very, very slowly to uncontrolled hysterical laughter... he staggers to his feet and reels across room helpless with mounting mirth and eventually collapses and dies on the floor.

ERIC IDLE:
It was obvious that this joke was lethal... no one could read it and live ...

DIRECTION:
The scribbler's mother (Eric) enters. She sees him dead, she gives a little cry of horror and bends over his body, weeping. Brokenly she notices the piece of paper in his hand and (thinking it is a suicide note - for he has not been doing well for the last thirteen years) picks it up and reads it between her sobs. Immediately she breaks out into hysterical laughter, leaps three feet into the air, and falls down dead without more ado. Cut to news type shot of commentator standing in front of the house.

DIRECTION:
reverentially

TERRY JONES:
This morning, shortly after eleven o'clock, comedy struck this little house in Dibley Road. Sudden ...violent ... comedy. Police have sealed off the area, and Scotland Yard's crack inspector is with me now.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I shall enter the house and attempt to remove the joke.

DIRECTION:
At this point an upstairs window in the house is flung open and a doctor, with stetoscope, rears his head out, hysterical with laughter, and dies hanging over the window sill. The commentator and the inspector look up briefly and sadly, and then continue as if they are used to such sights this morning.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I shall be aided by the sound of sombre music, played on gramophone records, and also by the chanting of laments by the men of Q Division ...

DIRECTION:
he indicates a little knot of dour-looking policemen standing nearby

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
The atmosphere thus created should protect me in the eventuality of me reading the joke.

DIRECTION:
He gives a signal. The group of policemen start groaning and chanting biblical laments. The Dead March is heard. The inspector squares his shoulders and bravely starts walking into the house.

TERRY JONES:
There goes a brave man. Whether he comes out alive or not, this will surely be remembered as one of the most courageous and gallant acts in police history.

DIRECTION:
The inspector suddenly appears at the door, helpless with laughter, holding the joke aloft. He collapses and dies.

DIRECTION:
Cut to film of army vans driving along dark roads.

Cut to a pillbox on the Salisbury Plain. Track in to slit to see moustachioed top brass peering anxiously out.

Top brass were impressed. Tests on Salisbury Plain confirmed the joke's devastating effectiveness at a range of up to fifty yards.

DIRECTION:
Cut to shot looking out of slit in pillbox. Zoom through slit to distance where a solitary figure is standing on the windswept plain. He is a bespectacled, weedy lance-corporal

DIRECTION:

DIRECTION:
Cut in to corporal's face - registening complete lack of comprehension as well as stupidity. Man on top of pillbox waves flag. The soldiers reveal the joke to the corporal. He peers at it, thinks about its meaning, sniggers, and dies. Two watching generals are very impressed.

DIRECTION:
Fantastic.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a Colonel talking to camera.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
All through the winter of '43 we had translators working, in joke-proof conditions, to try and produce a German version of the joke. They worked on one word each for greater safety. One of them saw two words of the joke and spent several weeks in hospital. But apart from that things went pretty quickly, and we soon had the joke by January, in a form which our troops couldn't understand but which the Germans could.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a trench in the Ardennes. Members of the joke brigade are crouched holding pieces of paper with the joke on them.

ERIC IDLE:
So, on July 8th, 1944, the joke was first told to the enemy in the Ardennes...

DIRECTION:
Tell the ... joke.

DIRECTION:
together

DIRECTION:
Wenn ist das Nunstruck git und Slotermeyer? Ja! ...      Beiherhund das Oder die Flipperwaldt gersput!

DIRECTION:
Pan out of the British trench across war-torn landscape and come to rest where      presumably the German trench is. There is a pause and then a group of Germans      rear up in hysterics.

ERIC IDLE:
It was a fantastic success. Over sixty thousand times as powerful as      Britain's great pre-war joke ...

DIRECTION:
Cut to a film of Chamberlain brandishing the 'Peace in our time' bit of paper.

ERIC IDLE:
In action it was deadly.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a small squad with rifles making their way through forest. Suddenly one of      them (a member of the joke squad) sees something and gives signal at which they all dive for cover. From the cover of a tree he reads out joke.

TERRY JONES:
Wenn ist das Nunstruck git und Slotermeyer? Ja! .. Beiherhund das Oder die Flipperwaldt gersput!

DIRECTION:
Sniper falls laughing out of tree.

Now if you don't tell me the joke, I shall hit you properly.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I can stand physical pain, you know.

JOHN CLEESE:
Ah ... you're no fun. All right, Otto.

DIRECTION:
Otto (Graham) starts tickling the officer who starts laughing.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh no - anything but that please no, all right I'll tell you.

DIRECTION:
They stop.

JOHN CLEESE:
Quick Otto. The typewriter.

DIRECTION:
Otto goes to the typewriter and they wait expectantly. The officer produces piece of      paper out of his breast pocket and reads.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Wenn ist das Nunstruck git und Slotermeyer? Ja! ... Beiherhund das Oder die Flipperwaldt gersput.

Otto at the typewriter explodes with laughter and dies.

ERIC IDLE:
In 1945 Peace broke out. It was the end of the Joke. Joke warfare was banned at a special session of the Geneva Convention, and in 1950 the last remaining copy of the joke was laid to rest here in the Berkshire countryside, never to be told again.

DIRECTION:
