ERIC IDLE:
This man is Ernest Scribbler... writer of jokes. In a few moments, he will have written the funniest joke in the world... and, as a consequence, he will die ... laughing.

ERIC IDLE:
It was obvious that this joke was lethal... no one could read it and live ...

TERRY JONES:
This morning, shortly after eleven o'clock, comedy struck this little house in Dibley Road. Sudden ...violent ... comedy. Police have sealed off the area, and Scotland Yard's crack inspector is with me now.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I shall enter the house and attempt to remove the joke.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I shall be aided by the sound of sombre music, played on gramophone records, and also by the chanting of laments by the men of Q Division ...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
The atmosphere thus created should protect me in the eventuality of me reading the joke.

TERRY JONES:
There goes a brave man. Whether he comes out alive or not, this will surely be remembered as one of the most courageous and gallant acts in police history.

ERIC IDLE:
It was not long before the Army became interested in the military potential of the Killer Joke. Under top security, the joke was hurried to a meeting of Allied Commanders at the Ministry of War.

ERIC IDLE:
Top brass were impressed. Tests on Salisbury Plain confirmed the joke's devastating effectiveness at a range of up to fifty yards.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
All through the winter of '43 we had translators working, in joke-proof conditions, to try and produce a German version of the joke. They worked on one word each for greater safety. One of them saw two words of the joke and spent several weeks in hospital. But apart from that things went pretty quickly, and we soon had the joke by January, in a form which our troops couldn't understand but which the Germans could.

ERIC IDLE:
So, on July 8th, 1944, the joke was first told to the enemy in the Ardennes...

ERIC IDLE:
It was a fantastic success. Over sixty thousand times as powerful as      Britain's great pre-war joke ...

ERIC IDLE:
...and one which Hitler just couldn't match.

ERIC IDLE:
In action it was deadly.

TERRY JONES:
Wenn ist das Nunstruck git und Slotermeyer? Ja! .. Beiherhund das Oder die Flipperwaldt gersput!

ERIC IDLE:
The German casualties were appalling.

JOHN CLEESE:
Vott is the big joke?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I can only give you name, rank, and why did the chicken cross the road?

JOHN CLEESE:
That's not funny!

JOHN CLEESE:
I vant to know the joke.

MICHAEL PALIN:
All right. How do you make a Nazi cross?

JOHN CLEESE:
I don't know ... how do you make a Nazi cross?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Tread on his corns.

JOHN CLEESE:
Gott in Himmel! That's not funny!

JOHN CLEESE:
Now if you don't tell me the joke, I shall hit you properly.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I can stand physical pain, you know.

JOHN CLEESE:
Ah ... you're no fun. All right, Otto.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh no - anything but that please no, all right I'll tell you.

JOHN CLEESE:
Quick Otto. The typewriter.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Wenn ist das Nunstruck git und Slotermeyer? Ja! ... Beiherhund das Oder die Flipperwaldt gersput.

JOHN CLEESE:
Ach! Zat iss not funny!

ERIC IDLE:
But at Peenemunde in the Autumn of '44, the Germans were working on a joke of their own.

ERIC IDLE:
Die ist ein Kinnerhunder und zwei Mackel über und der bitte schön ist den Wunderhaus sprechensie. 'Nein' sprecht der Herren 'Ist aufern borger mit zveitingen'.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
We let you know.

ERIC IDLE:
But by December their joke was ready, and Hitler gave the order for the German V-Joke to be broadcast in English.

ERIC IDLE:
In 1945 Peace broke out. It was the end of the Joke. Joke warfare was banned at a special session of the Geneva Convention, and in 1950 the last remaining copy of the joke was laid to rest here in the Berkshire countryside, never to be told again.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
And here is the final score: Pigs 9 - British Bipeds 4. The Pigs go on to meet Vicki Carr in the final.
