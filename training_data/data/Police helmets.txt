MICHAEL PALIN:
What am I wearing on my head?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
A helmet

DIRECTION:
correcting him

MICHAEL PALIN:
A policeman's helmet!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes.

DIRECTION:
taking off his helmet and demonstrating

MICHAEL PALIN:
You see that?

MICHAEL PALIN:
That little number there?

MICHAEL PALIN:
That is a Metropolitan Area Identification Code. No helmet is authentic without that number.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I see.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Kids helmets, helmets you get in toy shops, helmets you buy at Christmas. None of them is authentic ... Hang on.

DIRECTION:
he turns and crosses the busy road

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh could I ...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hang on!

DIRECTION:
He goes across to Mrs Edgeworth, and tries to grab the other chair from her. Mrs Edgeworth resists. He clouts her and pulls the chair away. He brings it back across the road and sits down next to the reporter.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Mind you I didn't join the police force just to wear the helmets you know. That just happens to be one of the little perks. There are plenty of jobs where I could have worn a helmet, but not such a nice helmet.

DIRECTION:
Mrs Edgeworth is gesticulating; another policeman comes up and drags her away

MICHAEL PALIN:
This helmet, I think, beats even some of the more elaborate helmets worn by the Tsar's private army, the so-called Axi red warriors. You know about them?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, no I don't.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah! Their helmets used to look like ... you got any paper?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well only these scripts.

DIRECTION:
The policeman gets up, looks up the street, and selects a businessman with a briefcase, who is hurrying away from him. The policeman runs up to him, grabs his arm, twists it up behind his back and wrenches the briefcase from his hand. He opens it, gets out some paper, then drops briefcase before the amazed owner, and ambles back to his chair, neatly grabbing a pen from a passer-by's inside pocket.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'll have that!

DIRECTION:
I say!

DIRECTION:
The policeman sits down again and starts to draw, talking the while.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Now then. Their helmet was not unlike the bobby's helmet in basic shape. It had an emblem here, and three gold - and in those days it really was gold, that's part of the reason the Tsar was so unpopular - three gold bands surmounted by a golden eagle on the apex here. Pretty nice helmet, eh?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I think the domed helmet wins every time over the flattened job, you know, even when they're three cornered ...

DIRECTION:
suddenly his eyes light on two office secretaries opening their packed lunch on a nearby seat

MICHAEL PALIN:
... you want something to eat?

DIRECTION:
sensing what's going to happen, hurriedly

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well no, er really ...

DIRECTION:
approaching the girls and getting out his notebook

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hang on. You can't park here you know.

DIRECTION:
bewildered

DIRECTION:
We're not parked!

MICHAEL PALIN:
No parked! What's that then?

DIRECTION:
That's our lunch.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right. I'm taking that in for forensic examination.

DIRECTION:
Why?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Because it might have been used as a murder weapon, that's why!

DIRECTION:
the girls look at each other; the policeman grabs their lunch

DIRECTION:
to the reporter

MICHAEL PALIN:
Beer?

DIRECTION:
desperately

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no, please ... honestly ... please ...

DIRECTION:
The policeman walks off. There is a crash of breaking glass. An alarm bell starts to ring. The reporter winces. The policeman walks into shot again, holding two bottles of beer. He sits down, opens the beers with his teeth and hands one to reporter who is very embarrassed.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Now, the Chaldeans, who used to inhabit the area in between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, their helmets were of the modular restrained kind of type ...
