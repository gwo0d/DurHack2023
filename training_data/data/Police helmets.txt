MICHAEL PALIN:
What am I wearing on my head?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
A helmet

MICHAEL PALIN:
A policeman's helmet!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You see that?

MICHAEL PALIN:
That little number there?

MICHAEL PALIN:
That is a Metropolitan Area Identification Code. No helmet is authentic without that number.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I see.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Kids helmets, helmets you get in toy shops, helmets you buy at Christmas. None of them is authentic ... Hang on.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh could I ...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hang on!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Mind you I didn't join the police force just to wear the helmets you know. That just happens to be one of the little perks. There are plenty of jobs where I could have worn a helmet, but not such a nice helmet.

MICHAEL PALIN:
This helmet, I think, beats even some of the more elaborate helmets worn by the Tsar's private army, the so-called Axi red warriors. You know about them?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, no I don't.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah! Their helmets used to look like ... you got any paper?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well only these scripts.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'll have that!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Now then. Their helmet was not unlike the bobby's helmet in basic shape. It had an emblem here, and three gold - and in those days it really was gold, that's part of the reason the Tsar was so unpopular - three gold bands surmounted by a golden eagle on the apex here. Pretty nice helmet, eh?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I think the domed helmet wins every time over the flattened job, you know, even when they're three cornered ...

MICHAEL PALIN:
... you want something to eat?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well no, er really ...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hang on. You can't park here you know.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No parked! What's that then?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right. I'm taking that in for forensic examination.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Because it might have been used as a murder weapon, that's why!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Beer?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no, please ... honestly ... please ...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Now, the Chaldeans, who used to inhabit the area in between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, their helmets were of the modular restrained kind of type ...
