ERIC IDLE:
Good morning. I've been in touch with you about the, er, life insurance...

JOHN CLEESE:
Ah yes, did you bring the um ... the specimen of your um ... and so on, and so on?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes I did. It's in the car. There's rather a lot.

JOHN CLEESE:
Good, good.

ERIC IDLE:
Do you really need twelve gallons?

JOHN CLEESE:
No, no, not really.

ERIC IDLE:
Do you test it?

JOHN CLEESE:
No.

ERIC IDLE:
Well, why do you want it?

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, we do it to make sure that you're serious about wanting insurance, I mean, if you're not, you won't spend a couple of months filling up that enormous churn with mmm, so on and so on...

ERIC IDLE:
Shall I bring it in?

JOHN CLEESE:
Good Lord no. Throw it away.

ERIC IDLE:
Throw it away? I was months filling that thing up.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And we've just heard that Her Majesty the Queen has just tuned into this programme and so she is now watching this royal sketch here in this royal set. The actor on the left is wearing the great grey suit of the BBC wardrobe department and the other actor is ... about to deliver the first great royal joke here this royal evening.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Over to the fight you can see the royal cameraman, and behind... Oh, we've just heard she's switched over. She's watching the 'News at Ten'.
