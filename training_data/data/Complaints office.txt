MICHAEL PALIN:
All right. Take a seat.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
You see! There ought to be a safety catch on it, I mean ... ohhhh!

CAROL CLEVELAND:
I mean, what if this fell into the wrong hands?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, madam. I'll speak to the makers personally, all right?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Would you? It would put my mind at ease.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Sorry...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Next?

TERRY GILLIAM:
He's still molesting her.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, yes, I'll see to you in a moment, sir.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I've got a complaint to make.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Do take a seat. I'm sorry it's on fire.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, not at all.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I got used to this out east.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Where were you out east?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, Norway ... Sweden ... places like that... oh I'm terribly sorry, my suit seems to keep catching fire.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Extinguisher?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh no, thank you, I think we'd better let it run its course. I was just thinking... Norway is not very east, is it? I should have said when I was out north.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Are there many fires in Norway?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Good Lord yes. The place is a constant blaze. Wooden buildings, d'you know. I lost my wife in Norway.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I am sorry to hear that.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Why, did you know her?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, I meant...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh I see. No, she wasn't a favourite of mine. We were out strolling across a fiord one day when one of the local matadors came out of his tree house and flung a load of old scimitars and guillotines out that he'd got cluttering up his wine cellar and apparently rather a large proportion of them landed on my wife causing her to snuff it without much more ado.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, yes - well look...

ERIC IDLE:
What a rotten ending.
