DIRECTION:
He grabs Chris's hair. A fight ensues in which all the assistants get their toupees dislodged. Chris is backed up against a door marked: 'Strictly no admittance'. He suddenly ducks out through this door. Cut to the other side of the door. Chris turns and double takes. It is the manager's office. There is a long line of people sitting waiting to complain. The manager looks up.

DIRECTION:
irritably

MICHAEL PALIN:
All right. Take a seat.

DIRECTION:
Chris shuts the door and takes a seat at the end of a line often people waiting to complain: the German clothes prop man; the Icelandic honey week man; a Greek with a motor tyre; a man with a lawn mower with a cat sticking out of it; a man with a bandaged nose holding a dog with a bandaged nose; a lady with a bandaged nose; a lady with a bandaged nose and a pram with a small column of smoke rising from it; a rather butch lady with her head through a tennis racket; a man with a cigar in his mouth that has obviously exploded - his face is blackened and his collar awry; a man in a terrible suit with one arm twice as long as a normal sleeve and trousers that finish at mid-thigh. A uniformed shop attendant is sitting next to a rather well dressed lady in twin set and pearls, and her equally distinguished looking husband. The attendant is occasionally touching the lady's cheek and peering into her eyes. The lady and the husband stare straight ahead. Next to them is Colonel Ewing. At the desk is the lady with the flame thrower. Part of the manager's desk and the entire corner of the office are blackened and smoking.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
You see! There ought to be a safety catch on it, I mean ... ohhhh!

DIRECTION:
a spurt of flame shoots out

CAROL CLEVELAND:
I mean, what if this fell into the wrong hands?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, madam. I'll speak to the makers personally, all right?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Would you? It would put my mind at ease.

DIRECTION:
She leaves closing the door. We hear the flame thrower.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Sorry...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Next?

DIRECTION:
The colonel gets up. As he does so Mr Zyndenky (the husband) indicates his wife and the attendant.

TERRY GILLIAM:
He's still molesting her.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, yes, I'll see to you in a moment, sir.

DIRECTION:
the colonel sits at the manager's desk

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I've got a complaint to make.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Do take a seat. I'm sorry it's on fire.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, not at all.

DIRECTION:
he sits on it

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I got used to this out east.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Where were you out east?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, Norway ... Sweden ... places like that... oh I'm terribly sorry, my suit seems to keep catching fire.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Extinguisher?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh no, thank you, I think we'd better let it run its course. I was just thinking... Norway is not very east, is it? I should have said when I was out north.

DIRECTION:
he slaps at the flames

MICHAEL PALIN:
Are there many fires in Norway?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Good Lord yes. The place is a constant blaze. Wooden buildings, d'you know. I lost my wife in Norway.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I am sorry to hear that.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Why, did you know her?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, I meant...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh I see. No, she wasn't a favourite of mine. We were out strolling across a fiord one day when one of the local matadors came out of his tree house and flung a load of old scimitars and guillotines out that he'd got cluttering up his wine cellar and apparently rather a large proportion of them landed on my wife causing her to snuff it without much more ado.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, yes - well look...

DIRECTION:
Ding-dong of store PA. An announcer speaks.

DIRECTION:
Here is an important announcement about Michael Ellis.

DIRECTION:
Chris looks up at loudspeaker; everyone turns towards it

DIRECTION:
murmur of excitment

ERIC IDLE:
What a rotten ending.
