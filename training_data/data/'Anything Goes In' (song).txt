clearing his throat and going into an extraordinary tuneless and very loud song

DIRECTION:
Anything goes in.

DIRECTION:
Anything goes out!

DIRECTION:
Fish, bananas, old pyjamas,

DIRECTION:
Mutton! Beef! and Trout!

DIRECTION:
Anything goes in ...

TERRY JONES:
No, that's not it ... carry on.

MICHAEL PALIN:
With respect sir, I shall seek to prove that the man before you in the dock being in the possession of the following: one pair of army boots, value three pounds seven and six, one pair of serge trousers, value two pounds three and six, one pair of gaiters value sixty-eight pounds ten shillings, one ...

TERRY JONES:
Sixty-eight pounds ten shillings for a pair of

DIRECTION:
gaiters

TERRY JONES:
?

DIRECTION:
dismissively

MICHAEL PALIN:
They were special gaiters, sir.

DIRECTION:
Special

TERRY JONES:
gaiters?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, sir, they were made in France. One beret costing fourteen shillings, one pair of ...

TERRY JONES:
What was special about them?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh ...

DIRECTION:
as if he can hardly be bothered to reply

MICHAEL PALIN:
they were made of a special fabric, sir. The buckles were made of empire silver instead of brass. The total value of the uniform was there ...

TERRY JONES:
Why was the accused wearing special gaiters?

DIRECTION:
irritably

MICHAEL PALIN:
They were a presentation pair sir, from the regiment. The total value of the uniform ...

TERRY JONES:
Why did they present him with a special pair of gaiters?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Sir, it seems to me totally irrelevant to the case whether the gaiters were presented to him or not, sir.

TERRY JONES:
I think the court will be able to judge that for themselves. I want to know why the regiment presented the accused with a special pair of gaiters.

DIRECTION:
stifling his impatience

MICHAEL PALIN:
He ... used to do things for them. The total value ...

TERRY JONES:
What things?

DIRECTION:
exasperated

MICHAEL PALIN:
He .. he used to oblige them, sir. The total value ...

DIRECTION:
Oblige

TERRY JONES:
them?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, sir. The total value of the uniform ...

TERRY JONES:
How did he oblige them?

MICHAEL PALIN:
What sir?

TERRY JONES:
How did he

DIRECTION:
oblige

DIRECTION:
more and more irritated

MICHAEL PALIN:
He ... um ... used to make them happy in little ways, sir. The total value of the uniform could therefore not have been less than ...

TERRY JONES:
Did he touch them at all?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Sir! I submit that this is totally irrelevant.

TERRY JONES:
I want to know how he made them happy.

DIRECTION:
losing his temper

MICHAEL PALIN:
He used to ram things up their ...

DIRECTION:
quickly

TERRY JONES:
All right! All right! No need to spell it out! What er ... what has the accused to say?

DIRECTION:
taken off guard

ERIC IDLE:
What, me?

TERRY JONES:
Yes. What have you got to say?

ERIC IDLE:
What can

DIRECTION:
I

ERIC IDLE:
say? I mean, how can I encapsulate in mere words my scorn for any military solution? The fultility of modern warfare? And the hypocrisy by which contemporary government applies one standard to violence within the community and another to violence perpetrated by one community upon another?

TERRY GILLIAM:
I'm sorry, but my client has become pretentious. I will say in his defense that he has suffered ...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Sir! We haven't finished the prosecution!

TERRY JONES:
Shut up! I'm in charge of this court.

everyone stands up

DIRECTION:
everyone sits down

DIRECTION:
everyone goes moo; the presiding general turns to Fawcett

DIRECTION:
everyone puts on pixie hats with large pointed ears

DIRECTION:
a skating vicar and everyone bursts into song

DIRECTION:
Anything goes in. Anything goes out!

Fish, bananas, old pyjamas,

Mutton! Beef! and Trout!

DIRECTION:
Anything goes in. Anything goes out.

etc.
