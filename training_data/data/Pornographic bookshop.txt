ERIC IDLE:
There's a 'Bridget - Queen of the Whip'.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes...

ERIC IDLE:
Or 'Naughty Nora'... or there's this one: 'Doug, Bob and Gordon Visit the

ERIC IDLE:
'. Or there's 'Sister Teresa - The Spanking Nun'.

JOHN CLEESE:
Mmmm... I see ... you don't have anything specially about Devon and Cornwall?

ERIC IDLE:
No. I'm afraid not, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
The one I was really after was Arthur Hotchkiss's 'Devonshire Country Churches'.

ERIC IDLE:
Well how about this, sir: 'Bum Biters'.

JOHN CLEESE:
No ... not really ... I don't suppose you have any general surveys of English Church architecture?

ERIC IDLE:
No, it's not really our line, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
No, I see. Well, never mind I'll just take the 'Lord Lieutenant in Nylons' then, and these two copies of 'Piggie Parade'. Thank you.

ERIC IDLE:
Right, sir.

TERRY JONES:
My Lord of Warwick.

ERIC IDLE:
'Allo?

TERRY JONES:
Raise high the drawbridge. Gloucester's troops approach!

ERIC IDLE:
Right.

TERRY GILLIAM:
Just these, then.

MICHAEL PALIN:
All right. This is a raid. My name is Superintendent Gaskell and this is Sergeant Maddox.

ERIC IDLE:
Ah! Sir Philip Sidney. 'Tis good to see thee on these shores again.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Shut up.

ERIC IDLE:
Your suit is fair and goodly cut. Was't from Antwerp?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Shut up. It's a disguise. Right! Confiscate the smutty books, Maddox.

ERIC IDLE:
Sir Philip!. Prithee nay!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Listen, mate! Don't come that Philip Sidney bit with me. I'm not a bloody Tudor at all. I'm Gaskell of the Vice Squad and this is Sergeant Maddox.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Maddox! Where's he gone?

ERIC IDLE:
Sir Philip, prithee rest awhile.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Look. This is the last time. I'm warning you, I'm not Sir Philip Bleeding Sidney. I am Superintendent Harold Gaskell and this is a raid.

ERIC IDLE:
That'll be 540 quid sir.

TERRY GILLIAM:
Oh, I'll just have this one then.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Maddox!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Where are you going?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'm going home.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'll remember you. Don't you worry. I'll remember you...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Pray good, Sir Philip, that you...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Don't you start! Maddox!

ERIC IDLE:
Farewell, good Sir Philip.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hey, stop!

MICHAEL PALIN:
You'll never get away with this, you porn merchant. Blimey!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Er, listen. My name is Caskell ... Superintendent Caskell of Vice Squad. Myself and Sergeant Maddox are on a raid. We are not Tudor people. We are the police.

TERRY JONES:
Frances, what idleness is this? Why, good Sir Philip Sidney,

TERRY JONES:
What hast thee here?

MICHAEL PALIN:
... Possibly... but I may be Superintendent Gaskell of the Vice Squad.

TERRY JONES:
Ah good, Sir Philip, thy sharp-tongued wit has not deserted thee. Come. Let us eat and drink. Stay with us awhile.

MICHAEL PALIN:
All right, sir. I think I will.

MICHAEL PALIN:
. .. then did we bust the Harry Tony mob, who did seek to import Scandinavian filth via Germany. For six years they cleaned up a packet - the day I got whiff of them through a squealer and within one week did a mop-up right good. They're now languishing doing five years bird in Parkhurst.

TERRY GILLIAM:
Sir Philip. The Spaniards have landed in the Netherlands. My Lord Walsingham needs you there forthwith.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Let's go.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Where are the Spaniards?

ERIC IDLE:
Down below Sir Philip, their first boats are landing even now.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right, you stay here, I'll go and get them.

ERIC IDLE:
Sir Philip! Not alone!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Allo allo! What's going on here?

TERRY JONES:
Ees nothing, Se単or, ees just some literature.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I know what literature is, you dago dustbin. I also know what porn is.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What's this then eh?

TERRY JONES:
It is one of Lope De Vega's latest play, Se単or.

MICHAEL PALIN:
'Toledo Tit Parade'? What sort of play's that?

TERRY JONES:
It's very visual, Se単or.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right. I'm taking this lot in the name of Her Gracious Majesty Queen Elizabeth.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, but Se単or.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Don't give me any trouble. Just pile up these baskets of filth and come with me.

TERRY JONES:
The battle raged long and hard, but as night fell Sidney overcame the Spaniards. 6,000 copies of 'Tits and Bums' and 4,000 copies of 'Shower Sheila' were seized that day. The tide of Spanish porn was stemmed. Sir Philip Sidney returned to London in triumph.

TERRY JONES:
Covered in glory, Sir Philip rode home to Pensburst to see his beloved wife... but all was not well.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good evening all, my love. I have returned safe from the Low Countries.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What are thou reading, fair one?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh, 'tis nothing, husband.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I can see 'tis

MICHAEL PALIN:
.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
'Tis one of Shakespeare's latest works.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh ...'Gay Boys in Bondage' What, is't - tragedy? Comedy?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
'Tis a... er... 'tis a story of a man's great love for his... fellow men.

MICHAEL PALIN:
How fortunate we are indeed to have such a poet on these shores.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Indeed. How was the war, my lord?

MICHAEL PALIN:
The Spaniards were defeated thrice. Six dozen chests of hardcore captured.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Hast brought home any spoils of war?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, good my wife, this fair coat trimmed with ermine.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh, lovely, nowt else?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, no fair lady. The rest was too smutty.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Now, my good wife. Whilst I rest, read to me a while from Shakespeare's 'Gay Boys in Bondage'.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Yes... my lord ... 'Gay Boys in Bondage' ... Ken, 25, is a mounted policeman with a difference... and what a difference. Even Roger is surprised and he's...

CAROL CLEVELAND:
he's used to real men ...

MICHAEL PALIN:
'Tis like 'Hamlet' ... what a genius!

CAROL CLEVELAND:
'But who's going to do the cooking tonight? Roddy's got a mouthful...'

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
All right, this is a raid.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh! We are disgraced!

MICHAEL PALIN:
There you are, Maddox!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Cut the chat... and get in the van.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Maddox! You recognize me...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Indeed I do, Sir Philip Sidney, and sad I am to see you caught up in this morass of filth,

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
ooh - that's a long one.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh oh... the glorious name of Sidney is besmirched ... all is lost ... oh alas the day.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Shut up! I know this man - this is my old mate Sergeant Maddox...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You'll do time for this.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh Maddox - it's me - Gaskell ... 'F' division down at Acton ... Inspector Arthur Frodwell.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Come on Sidney.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
And you, miss.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'm not Sir Philip bleedin' Sidney .... and where were you? We could have mopped up that Tudor shop...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ooh! That's a good one!
