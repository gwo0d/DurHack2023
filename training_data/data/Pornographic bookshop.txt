ERIC IDLE:
There's a 'Bridget - Queen of the Whip'.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes...

ERIC IDLE:
Or 'Naughty Nora'... or there's this one: 'Doug, Bob and Gordon Visit the

DIRECTION:
Ark Royal

ERIC IDLE:
'. Or there's 'Sister Teresa - The Spanking Nun'.

JOHN CLEESE:
Mmmm... I see ... you don't have anything specially about Devon and Cornwall?

ERIC IDLE:
No. I'm afraid not, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
The one I was really after was Arthur Hotchkiss's 'Devonshire Country Churches'.

ERIC IDLE:
Well how about this, sir: 'Bum Biters'.

JOHN CLEESE:
No ... not really ... I don't suppose you have any general surveys of English Church architecture?

ERIC IDLE:
No, it's not really our line, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
No, I see. Well, never mind I'll just take the 'Lord Lieutenant in Nylons' then, and these two copies of 'Piggie Parade'. Thank you.

ERIC IDLE:
Right, sir.

DIRECTION:
voice over

TERRY JONES:
My Lord of Warwick.

ERIC IDLE:
'Allo?

TERRY JONES:
Raise high the drawbridge. Gloucester's troops approach!

ERIC IDLE:
Right.

DIRECTION:
He presses a button below counter and the wall slides back. The man with the big pile of books comes up to counter.

TERRY GILLIAM:
Just these, then.

DIRECTION:
Enter Gaskell in Tudor gear. The wall closes up behind him.

MICHAEL PALIN:
All right. This is a raid. My name is Superintendent Gaskell and this is Sergeant Maddox.

ERIC IDLE:
Ah! Sir Philip Sidney. 'Tis good to see thee on these shores again.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Shut up.

ERIC IDLE:
Your suit is fair and goodly cut. Was't from Antwerp?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Shut up. It's a disguise. Right! Confiscate the smutty books, Maddox.

ERIC IDLE:
Sir Philip!. Prithee nay!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Listen, mate! Don't come that Philip Sidney bit with me. I'm not a bloody Tudor at all. I'm Gaskell of the Vice Squad and this is Sergeant Maddox.

DIRECTION:
They all look at him blankly. He looks to Maddox for support and realizes he isn't there.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Maddox! Where's he gone?

ERIC IDLE:
Sir Philip, prithee rest awhile.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Look. This is the last time. I'm warning you, I'm not Sir Philip Bleeding Sidney. I am Superintendent Harold Gaskell and this is a raid.

DIRECTION:
Everybody resumes their book-buying and ignores him. At the counter the assistant is still totting up the huge pile of books.

ERIC IDLE:
That'll be 540 quid sir.

TERRY GILLIAM:
Oh, I'll just have this one then.

DIRECTION:
takes top one

MICHAEL PALIN:
Maddox!

DIRECTION:
addressing everyone in shop; they ignore him

DIRECTION:
no reaction

DIRECTION:
people start to leave through the rear door of the shop; Gaskell blocks it

MICHAEL PALIN:
Where are you going?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'm going home.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right.

DIRECTION:
looks for his notebook but it's not in his Tudor clothing

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'll remember you. Don't you worry. I'll remember you...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Pray good, Sir Philip, that you...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Don't you start! Maddox!

DIRECTION:
the customer leaves; other customers start to leave

DIRECTION:
the vicar comes up to counter

DIRECTION:
the vicar leaves guiltily

ERIC IDLE:
Farewell, good Sir Philip.

DIRECTION:
He goes out carrying a pile of magazines. Then the vicar goes, followed by the Tudor man.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hey, stop!

DIRECTION:
the door slams; Gaskell turns and looks round the empty shop; pause

DIRECTION:
He rushes up to the sliding wall and beats on it. Then he turns and makes for the little back door and goes through.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You'll never get away with this, you porn merchant. Blimey!

DIRECTION:
He stops and gapes. We cut to his eye-line to see he is standing in a beautiful, green, Tudor garden. In the distance a Tudor house. A girl is sitting on a stone bench, sobbing. Gaskell walks towards her, bewildered.

DIRECTION:
The girl looks up at him with beseeching eyes. She is young and beautiful.

DIRECTION:
Oh good sir, how glad I am to see thee come. Forgive me weeping, but my love has gone.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Er, listen. My name is Caskell ... Superintendent Caskell of Vice Squad. Myself and Sergeant Maddox are on a raid. We are not Tudor people. We are the police.

DIRECTION:
An Elizabethan gentleman appears through the trees.

TERRY JONES:
Frances, what idleness is this? Why, good Sir Philip Sidney,

DIRECTION:
he bows extravagantly to Gaskell

TERRY JONES:
What hast thee here?

DIRECTION:
turning to Caskell with bated breath

DIRECTION:
You are Sir Philip Sidney?

MICHAEL PALIN:
... Possibly... but I may be Superintendent Gaskell of the Vice Squad.

TERRY JONES:
Ah good, Sir Philip, thy sharp-tongued wit has not deserted thee. Come. Let us eat and drink. Stay with us awhile.

MICHAEL PALIN:
All right, sir. I think I will.

DIRECTION:
They walk off together arm in arm into the idyllic country garden. The girl looks after them with hope in her eyes. Bring up Elizabethan music.

DIRECTION:
SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'THE LIFE OF SIR PHILIP SIDNEY'

DIRECTION:
Mix through to a Tudor dining room. At the table a group of Tudor gentry are sitting listening to Gaskell. Evidence of a banquet, and two minstrels in attendance. Gaskell has obviously just finished a story. Applause and laughter.

MICHAEL PALIN:
. .. then did we bust the Harry Tony mob, who did seek to import Scandinavian filth via Germany. For six years they cleaned up a packet - the day I got whiff of them through a squealer and within one week did a mop-up right good. They're now languishing doing five years bird in Parkhurst.

DIRECTION:
Applause. They are all very impressed. Cut to exterior. A messenger on a horse rides full pelt straight towards the camera. It is dusk. He stops outside the Elizabethan house, leaps off and dashes into the house. Cut to interior again. They are still all laughing from his last story. The messenger bursts into room.

TERRY GILLIAM:
Sir Philip. The Spaniards have landed in the Netherlands. My Lord Walsingham needs you there forthwith.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Let's go.

DIRECTION:
Cut to exterior. Gaskell is seated on the back of the messenger's horse and they gallop off. The dinner crowd are standing waving on the doorstep.

DIRECTION:
Good luck, Sir Philip!

DIRECTION:
Cut to a British standard fluttering in the breeze against the blue sky. Fanfare. Two Elizabethan gentlemen, and four men dressed as Elizabethan soldiers are standing on a cliff top. Gaskell strides up to them, and takes up position on topmost point of the knoll.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Where are the Spaniards?

ERIC IDLE:
Down below Sir Philip, their first boats are landing even now.

DIRECTION:
Shot of a sailing-galley seen from above.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right, you stay here, I'll go and get them.

ERIC IDLE:
Sir Philip! Not alone!

DIRECTION:
Cut to the beach. Suspense music. Gaskell strides up to the camera, until he is towering over it. The music reaches crescendo.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Allo allo! What's going on here?

DIRECTION:
Cut to beached rowing boat piled high with bundles of dirty magazines. Two Spaniards are unloading it.

TERRY JONES:
Ees nothing, Se単or, ees just some literature.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I know what literature is, you dago dustbin. I also know what porn is.

DIRECTION:
pulls out a loose magazine and brandishes it

MICHAEL PALIN:
What's this then eh?

TERRY JONES:
It is one of Lope De Vega's latest play, Se単or.

MICHAEL PALIN:
'Toledo Tit Parade'? What sort of play's that?

TERRY JONES:
It's very visual, Se単or.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right. I'm taking this lot in the name of Her Gracious Majesty Queen Elizabeth.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, but Se単or.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Don't give me any trouble. Just pile up these baskets of filth and come with me.

DIRECTION:
The second Spaniard leaps out of the boat with a drawn sword and they both engage Gaskell in a fight. Then we start to draw away from them, leaving them tiny dots in the distance fighting. Fight music over all this and voice over.

TERRY JONES:
The battle raged long and hard, but as night fell Sidney overcame the Spaniards. 6,000 copies of 'Tits and Bums' and 4,000 copies of 'Shower Sheila' were seized that day. The tide of Spanish porn was stemmed. Sir Philip Sidney returned to London in triumph.

DIRECTION:
Cut to stock film of Elizabethan London street during celebrations.

DIRECTION:
SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'LONDON 1583'

DIRECTION:
Cut to side on close up of Gaskell riding hard through woodland.

TERRY JONES:
Covered in glory, Sir Philip rode home to Pensburst to see his beloved wife... but all was not well.

DIRECTION:
Gaskell runs up outside another Tudor house and strides in. Cut to interior of an Elizabethan room - panelled walls, log fire, latticed windows, etc. Sir Philip's wife is sitting reading. Gaskell enters.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good evening all, my love. I have returned safe from the Low Countries.

DIRECTION:
she hurriedly hides the book she is reading under some knitting and starts whistling

MICHAEL PALIN:
What are thou reading, fair one?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh, 'tis nothing, husband.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I can see 'tis

DIRECTION:
something

MICHAEL PALIN:
.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
'Tis one of Shakespeare's latest works.

DIRECTION:
Gaskell picks up the book and reads the title.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh ...'Gay Boys in Bondage' What, is't - tragedy? Comedy?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
'Tis a... er... 'tis a story of a man's great love for his... fellow men.

MICHAEL PALIN:
How fortunate we are indeed to have such a poet on these shores.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Indeed. How was the war, my lord?

MICHAEL PALIN:
The Spaniards were defeated thrice. Six dozen chests of hardcore captured.

DIRECTION:
trying to look innocent

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Hast brought home any spoils of war?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, good my wife, this fair coat trimmed with ermine.

DIRECTION:
without enthusiasm

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh, lovely, nowt else?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, no fair lady. The rest was too smutty.

DIRECTION:
He settles himself down in front of his lady's feet and the fire.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Now, my good wife. Whilst I rest, read to me a while from Shakespeare's 'Gay Boys in Bondage'.

DIRECTION:
The wife looks a trifle taken aback but reluctantly opens the book and starts to read with a resigned air.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Yes... my lord ... 'Gay Boys in Bondage' ... Ken, 25, is a mounted policeman with a difference... and what a difference. Even Roger is surprised and he's...

DIRECTION:
she looks slightly, sick with guilt

CAROL CLEVELAND:
he's used to real men ...

MICHAEL PALIN:
'Tis like 'Hamlet' ... what a genius!

CAROL CLEVELAND:
'But who's going to do the cooking tonight? Roddy's got a mouthful...'

DIRECTION:
Enter Maddox - a modern-day plain-clothed policeman.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
All right, this is a raid.

DIRECTION:
The wife screams, Gaskell leaps to his feet.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh! We are disgraced!

MICHAEL PALIN:
There you are, Maddox!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Cut the chat... and get in the van.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Maddox! You recognize me...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Indeed I do, Sir Philip Sidney, and sad I am to see you caught up in this morass of filth,

DIRECTION:
he picks up the book

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
ooh - that's a long one.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh oh... the glorious name of Sidney is besmirched ... all is lost ... oh alas the day.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Shut up! I know this man - this is my old mate Sergeant Maddox...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You'll do time for this.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh Maddox - it's me - Gaskell ... 'F' division down at Acton ... Inspector Arthur Frodwell.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Come on Sidney.

DIRECTION:
he bundles them both out

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
And you, miss.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'm not Sir Philip bleedin' Sidney .... and where were you? We could have mopped up that Tudor shop...

DIRECTION:
They are bundled out. Maddox pauses only to pick a book from the bookcase near the door.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ooh! That's a good one!

DIRECTION:
Cut to outside a modern theatre stage-door. Gaskell, still protesting, and Mrs Sidney are bundled out and into a police van. As it drives off, it reveals on the side of the theatre a poster saying 'The Aldwych Theatre, The Royal Shakespeare Company Presents 'Gay Boys In Bondage' By William Shakespeare'.
