GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, I've been a hunter all my life. I love animals. That's why I like to kill 'em. I wouldn't kill an animal I didn't like. Goodday Roy.

JOHN CLEESE:
Hank and Roy Spim are tough, fearless backwoodsmen who have chosen to live in a violent, unrelenting world of nature's creatures, where only the fittest survive. Today they are off to hunt mosquitoes.

ERIC IDLE:
The mosquito's a clever little bastard. You can track him for days and days until you really get to know him like a friend. He knows you're there, and you know he's there. It's a game of wits. You hate him, then you respect him, then you kill him.

JOHN CLEESE:
Suddenly Hank spots the mosquito they're after.

JOHN CLEESE:
Now more than ever, they must rely on the skills they have learnt from a lifetime's hunting.

ERIC IDLE:
There's nothing more dangerous than a wounded mosquito.

JOHN CLEESE:
But the hunt is not over. With well practised skill Hank skins the mosquito.

JOHN CLEESE:
Here, surrounded by their trophies Roy and Hank prepare for a much tougher ordeal - a moth hunt.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, I follow the moth in the helicopter to lure it away from the flowers, and then Roy comes along in the Lockheed Starfighter and attacks it with air-to-air missiles.

ERIC IDLE:
A lot of people have asked us why we don't use fly spray. Well, where's the sport in that?

JOHN CLEESE:
For Roy, sport is everything. Ever since he lost his left arm battling with an ant, Roy has risked his life in the pursuit of tiny creatures.

JOHN CLEESE:
Wherever there is a challenge, Hank and Roy Spim will be there ready to carry on this primordial struggle between man and inoffensive, tiny insects.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, I've had such a morning in the High Court. I could stamp my little feet the way those QC's carry on.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Don't I know it, love.

ERIC IDLE:
Objection here, objection there! And that nice policeman giving his evidence so well - beautiful speaking voice ... well after a bit all I could do was bang my little gavel.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You what, love?

ERIC IDLE:
I banged me gavel. I did me 'silence in court' bit. Ooh! If looks could kill that prosecuting counsel would be in for thirty years. How did your summing up go?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, I was quite pleased actually. I was trying to do my butch voice, you know, 'what the jury must understand', and they loved it, you know. I could see that foreman eyeing me.

ERIC IDLE:
Really?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, cheeky devil.

ERIC IDLE:
Was he that tall man with that very big... ?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, just a minute - I must finish you know. Anyway, I finished up with 'the actions of these vicious men is a violent stain on the community and the full penalty of the law is scarcely sufficient to deal with their ghastly crimes', and I waggled my wig! Just ever so slightly, but it was a stunning effect.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, I bet it was... like that super time I wore that striped robe in the Magistrates Court.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, aye.
