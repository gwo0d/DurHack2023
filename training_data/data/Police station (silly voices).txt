behind station counter into camera

JOHN CLEESE:
Goodnight.

Camera pulls back to show a man standing in front of the counter.

TERRY JONES:
Good evening, I wish to report a burglary.

JOHN CLEESE:
Speak up please, sir.

TERRY JONES:
I wish to report a burglary.

JOHN CLEESE:
I can't hear you, sir.

DIRECTION:
bellowing

TERRY JONES:
I wish to report a burglary!

JOHN CLEESE:
That's a little bit too loud. Can you say it just a little less loud than that?

DIRECTION:
a little louder than normal

JOHN CLEESE:
No... I'm still not getting anything... Er, could you try it in a higher register?

TERRY JONES:
What do you mean in a higher register?

JOHN CLEESE:
What?

DIRECTION:
in a high-pitched voice

JOHN CLEESE:
Ahl That's it, hang on a moment.

DIRECTION:
gets out pencil and paper

JOHN CLEESE:
Now a little bit louder.

DIRECTION:
louder and more high pitched

JOHN CLEESE:
Report a what?

DIRECTION:
by now a ridiculously high-pitched squeak

TERRY JONES:
Burglary!

JOHN CLEESE:
That's the exact frequency... now keep it there.

DIRECTION:
Another sergeant enters and goes round to back of counter.

DIRECTION:
in high-pitched voice

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Hello, sarge!

DIRECTION:
in very deep voice

JOHN CLEESE:
Evening Charlie.

DIRECTION:
The second sergeant is taking his coat off, and the first one begins to pack up his papers. The man carries on with his tale of woe, but still in a high-pitched shriek.

TERRY JONES:
I was sitting at home with a friend of mine from Camber Sands, when we heard a noise in the bedroom. We went to investigate and found £5,000 stolen.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, I'm afraid I'm going off duty now sir. Er, could you tell First Sergeant Foster?

DIRECTION:
He leaves counter. Sergeant Foster comes forward with a helpful smile.

DIRECTION:
continues in high-pitched shriek

TERRY JONES:
I was sitting at home with a friend of mine.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Excuse me sir, but, er, why the funny voice?

DIRECTION:
normal voice

TERRY JONES:
Oh, terribly sorry. I'd just got used to talking like that to the other sergeant.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'm terribly sorry... I can't hear you, sir, could you try speaking in a lower register?

TERRY JONES:
What! Oh

DIRECTION:
in a very deep voice

TERRY JONES:
I wish to report the loss of £5,000.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
£5,000? That's serious, you'd better speak to the detective inspector.

DIRECTION:
At that moment, via the miracle of cueing, the detective inspector comes out of his office.

DIRECTION:
in very slow deep voice

ERIC IDLE:
What's the trouble, sergeant?

DIRECTION:
speaking at fantastic speed

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well- this- gentleman- sir- has- just- come- in- to- report- that- he- was- sitting- at- home- with- a- friend- when- he- heard- a- noise- in- the- backroom- went- round- to- investigate- and- found- that-£5,000- in- savings- had- been- stolen.

DIRECTION:
deep voice

DIRECTION:
turns to man and addresses him in normal voice

ERIC IDLE:
Where do you live sir?

TERRY JONES:
121, Halliwell Road, Dulwich, SE21

DIRECTION:
The detective inspector has been straining to hear but has failed. The second sergeant comes in helpfully.

DIRECTION:
fast

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
121- Halliwell- Road- Dulwich- SE21

DIRECTION:
squeak

ERIC IDLE:
Another Halliwell Road job eh, sergeant?

DIRECTION:
fast

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes- I- can't- believe- it- I- thought- the- bloke- who'd- done- that- was- put- inside- last- year.

DIRECTION:
squeak

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, in Parkhurst.

DIRECTION:
deep

JOHN CLEESE:
Well it must have been somebody else.

DIRECTION:
very deep

DIRECTION:
normal voice to man

DIRECTION:
he picks up phone and dials, at the same time he shrieks in high voice to the tint sergeant

DIRECTION:
very deep voice to the second sergeant

DIRECTION:
ridiculous sing-song voice into phone

ERIC IDLE:
Ha-allo Dar-ling, I'm afra-ID I sh-A-ll BE L-ate H-O-me this evening.

DIRECTION:
Meanwhile the second sergeant has a radio-controlled microphone and is singing down it in fine operatic tenor.

DIRECTION:
singing

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Calling all squad cars in the area...

DIRECTION:
Cut to vox pops.

DIRECTION:
in deep male voice, dubbed on

DIRECTION:
I think that's in very bad taste.

DIRECTION:
meows

DIRECTION:
barks

DIRECTION:
superimposed sheep bleating

JOHN CLEESE:
Some people do talk in the most extraordinary way.
