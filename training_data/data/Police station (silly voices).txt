Good evening, I wish to report a burglary.

Speak up please, sir.

TERRY JONES:
I wish to report a burglary.

JOHN CLEESE:
I can't hear you, sir.

TERRY JONES:
I wish to report a burglary!

JOHN CLEESE:
That's a little bit too loud. Can you say it just a little less loud than that?

JOHN CLEESE:
No... I'm still not getting anything... Er, could you try it in a higher register?

TERRY JONES:
What do you mean in a higher register?

JOHN CLEESE:
What?

JOHN CLEESE:
Ahl That's it, hang on a moment.

JOHN CLEESE:

I was sitting at home with a friend of mine from Camber Sands, when we heard a noise in the bedroom. We went to investigate and found £5,000 stolen.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, I'm afraid I'm going off duty now sir. Er, could you tell First Sergeant Foster?

TERRY JONES:
I was sitting at home with a friend of mine.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Excuse me sir, but, er, why the funny voice?

TERRY JONES:
Oh, terribly sorry. I'd just got used to talking like that to the other sergeant.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'm terribly sorry... I can't hear you, sir, could you try speaking in a lower register?

TERRY JONES:
What! Oh

TERRY JONES:
I wish to report the loss of £5,000.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
£5,000? That's serious, you'd better speak to the detective inspector.
