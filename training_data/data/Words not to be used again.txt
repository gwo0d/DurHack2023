MICHAEL PALIN:
These are the words that are not to be used again on this programme.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Out!

JOHN CLEESE:
Right, who's got a boil on his Semprini, then?

ERIC IDLE:
Good morning.

TERRY JONES:
Good morning, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
Good morning. I'd like some aftershave, please.

TERRY JONES:
Ah, certainly. Walk this way, please.

ERIC IDLE:
If I could walk that way I wouldn't need aftershave.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good morning, sir. Can I help you?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes. I'd like some aftershave.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah. A toilet requisite-t-t-t-t-t... Would you like to try this, sir. It's our very very latest, it's called Sea Mist.

ERIC IDLE:
I quite like it.

MICHAEL PALIN:
How about something a little more musky? This one's called Mimmo.

ERIC IDLE:
Not really, no. Have you anything a little more fishier?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Fishier?

ERIC IDLE:
Fishier.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Fish, fish, fish. A fishy requisite-t-t-t-t-t...

ERIC IDLE:
Like halibut or sea bass.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Or bream?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, we haven't got any of that... ah, I've got mackerel... or cod... or hake...

ERIC IDLE:
You haven't got anything a little more halibutish?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Er... parrot? What's that doing there? Or skate with just a hint of prawn? Or crab, tiger and almonds, very unusual.

ERIC IDLE:
I really had my heart set on halibut.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, sir, we had a fishy consignment in this morning, so I could nip down to the basement and see if I can come up trumps on this particular requisite-t-t-t-t-t. So it was halibut... or... ?

ERIC IDLE:
Sea bass.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Sea bass. Won't be a moment.

ERIC IDLE:
as though he's gone down ... to the basement. Actually I think he's rather overdoing it. Ah!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, sorry, sir.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, I'm afraid it didn't come in this morning, sir. But we have got some down at our Kensington branch. I'll just nip down there and get it for you.

ERIC IDLE:
How long will that be?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Twenty minutes.

ERIC IDLE:
Twenty minutes!
