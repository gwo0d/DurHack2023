ERIC IDLE:
I quite like it.

MICHAEL PALIN:
How about something a little more musky? This one's called Mimmo.

Fishier?

Fishier.

Fish, fish, fish. A fishy requisite-t-t-t-t-t...

Like halibut or sea bass.

Or bream?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, we haven't got any of that... ah, I've got mackerel... or cod... or hake...

ERIC IDLE:
You haven't got anything a little more halibutish?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Er... parrot? What's that doing there? Or skate with just a hint of prawn? Or crab, tiger and almonds, very unusual.

ERIC IDLE:
I really had my heart set on halibut.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, sir, we had a fishy consignment in this morning, so I could nip down to the basement and see if I can come up trumps on this particular requisite-t-t-t-t-t. So it was halibut... or... ?

Sea bass.

Sea bass. Won't be a moment.

Twenty minutes.
