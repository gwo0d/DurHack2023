CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh Robert, tell me I'm beautiful.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh you are, you are!

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh Robert, do you mean that?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Of course I do.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
You're not just saying that because I asked you?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Of course not.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh Robert ... Robert, are you sure it doesn't put you off?

MICHAEL PALIN:
What?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
My father wanting to come and live with us.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, of course I don't mind your father coming to live with us.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
He wouldn't just be living with us.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What do you mean?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Well, he finds it very difficult to get to sleep on his own, so I said he could sleep with us.

MICHAEL PALIN:
He wants to put his bed in our room?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
No, no, of course not.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh good ...

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Our bed is plenty big enough for three ...

CAROL CLEVELAND:
He'd just get into bed and go to sleep.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No. I'm not having that.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh Robert, I thought you loved me?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well I do, but ...

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Well, he wouldn't look.

MICHAEL PALIN:
He's bound to peek.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
No, no, he wouldn't honestly.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No! No! No!!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You young couple just carry on. Take no notice of me ...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I don't want to feel as though I'm getting in the way.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh no dad, you're not.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, no.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Good.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Well, I think I'll get to sleep.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Are you sure?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh yes, I'm a bit tired after the wedding.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Bob, what about you?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh yes, all right, yes.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh well, I seem to be O/C lights.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Good night, darling.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good night.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Good night!

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Father. Father, what are you doing?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'm making a boat.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
What?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It's the Cutty Sark. It's a model I've been making in the dark for some years now.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Well, wouldn't it be better with the light on?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no, I'm making it in the dark, that's the point.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh dear, not as accurate as I thought.

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's not the Cutty Sark!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well it hasn't got its sails yet. Oh well I'll ... I'll have a look at it in the dark room in the morning. Good night.

TERRY GILLIAM:
Shut up! Will you shut up in there!

TERRY GILLIAM:
Shut up!

TERRY GILLIAM:
That's better.
