GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, if you can imagine the size of Nelson's Column, which is roughly three times the size of a London bus, then Tschaikowsky was much smaller. His head was about the same size as that of an extremely large dog, that is to say, two very small dogs, or four very large hamsters, or one medium-size rabbit if you count the whole of the body and not just the head.

A chained figure in a sack rolls into shot and starts rolling about and playing the piano concerto. After a minute 'Rita' enters and gestures to him. She is in fish-net tights, etc, - the full conjurer's assistant. He wriggles free from the sack, playing the while. The music stops.
