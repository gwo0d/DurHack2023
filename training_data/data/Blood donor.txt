JOHN CLEESE:
Blood donors that way, please.

JOHN CLEESE:
Thank you.

JOHN CLEESE:
No. There is no such thing as a urine bank.

ERIC IDLE:
Please.

JOHN CLEESE:
No. We have no call for it. We've quite enough of it without volunteers coming in here donating it.

ERIC IDLE:
Just a specimen.

JOHN CLEESE:
No, we don't want a specimen. We either want your blood or nothing.

ERIC IDLE:
I'll give you some blood if you'll give me...

JOHN CLEESE:
What?

ERIC IDLE:
A thing to do some urine in.

JOHN CLEESE:
No, no, just go away please.

ERIC IDLE:
Anyway, I don't want to give you any blood.

JOHN CLEESE:
Fine, well you don't have to, you see, just go away.

ERIC IDLE:
Can I give you some spit?

JOHN CLEESE:
No.

ERIC IDLE:
Sweat?

ERIC IDLE:
Earwax?

JOHN CLEESE:
No, look, this is a blood bank - all we want is blood.

ERIC IDLE:
All right, I'll give you some blood.

JOHN CLEESE:
Wher did you get that?

ERIC IDLE:
Today. It's today's.

JOHN CLEESE:
What group is it?

ERIC IDLE:
What groups are there?

JOHN CLEESE:
There's A...

ERIC IDLE:
It's A.

JOHN CLEESE:
Wait a moment. It's mine. This blood is mine! What are you doing with it?

ERIC IDLE:
I found it.

JOHN CLEESE:
You

JOHN CLEESE:
it? You stole it out of my body, didn't you?

ERIC IDLE:
No.

JOHN CLEESE:
No wonder I'm feeling off-colour.

JOHN CLEESE:
Give that back.

ERIC IDLE:
It's mine.

JOHN CLEESE:
It is not yours. You stole it.

ERIC IDLE:
Never.

JOHN CLEESE:
Give it back to me.

ERIC IDLE:
All right. But only if I can give urine.

JOHN CLEESE:
...Get in the queue.
