CAPTION: 'THE MAKERS OF THIS FILM WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE FOLLOWING PEOPLE WHO GAVE US LOTS OF MONEY TO SEE THEIR NAMES IN LIGHTS: VICTOR - HIS FRIEND BOBBY - AND - MARY

DIRECTION:
Pull back to show that 'Mary' is part of a sign saying: 'Mary Recruitment Office'. Pull out to reveal that it is a sign over a shop as for army recruiting office. An RSM with waxed moustache and snappy straight-against-the-forehead peaked cap comes out of the shop. He hangs a clearly printed sign on a nail on the door. It reads: 'Sketch just starting - actor wanted'.

JOHN CLEESE:
Sketch just starting, actor wanted.

DIRECTION:
The RSM looks up and down the road, glances up at the sign above his shop without noticing it. He goes inside again. A man walks up, reads the sign and enters. He is Mr Man.

ERIC IDLE:
Good morning.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Morning, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
I'd like to join the army please.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I see. Short service or long service commission, sir?

ERIC IDLE:
As long as possible please.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Right well I'll just take a few particulars and then...

DIRECTION:
Suddenly he looks as though a dim memory has penetrated his skull. He breaks off, looking thoughtful, walks towards the door and exits. He comes out of shop, looks up at word 'Mary', tuts and changes the letters round to read 'Army'. He suddenly looks round and we see a queue of nuns.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Shove off!

DIRECTION:
he goes back inside

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Then there'll be a few forms to sign, and of course we'll need references and then a full medical examination by the ...

ERIC IDLE:
Yes. Yes, yes I see.

DIRECTION:
diffidently

ERIC IDLE:
I was just wondering whether it would be possible for me to join... the women's army?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
The Women's Royal Army Corps, sir?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes. I was just thinking, you know, if it was possible for me to have my choice ... I'd prefer to be in the Women's Royal Amy Corps.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, I'm afraid that the people that recruit here normally go straight into the Scots Guards.

ERIC IDLE:
Which is all... men... I suppose?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes it is.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes. Are there any regiments which are more effeminate than others?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, no sir. I mean, apart from the Marines, they're all dead butch.

ERIC IDLE:
You see, what I really wanted was a regiment where I could be really quiet and have more time to myself to work with fabrics, and creating new concepts in interior design.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Working with fabrics and experimenting with interior design!

ERIC IDLE:
Yes.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh well you want the Durham Light Infantry then, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh yes. That's the only regiment that's really doing something new with interior design, with colour, texture, line and that.

ERIC IDLE:
I see.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh yes, I mean their use of colour with fabrics is fantastic. I saw their pattern book the other day - beautiful, beautiful. Savage tans, great slabs of black set against aggressive orange. It really makes you want to shout out, this is good! This is real!

ERIC IDLE:
Really?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh yes. I mean the Inniskillin Fusiliers and the Anglian Regiment are all right if you're interested in the art nouveau William Morris revival bit, but if you really want a regiment of the line that is really saying something about interior decor, then you've got to go for the Durham Light Infantry.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, I've had enough of this. I'm handing in my notice.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What do you mean?

ERIC IDLE:
Well I mean, when I applied for this job I thought I'd get a few decent lines but you end up doing the whole thing. I mean my last five speeches have been 'really, really - I see - I see' and 'really'. I wouldn't give those lines to a dog.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
All right, all right, all right, sonny. I'll tell you what. We'll do something different. I'll be a bus conductor, and you can be a really funny passenger on a bus.
