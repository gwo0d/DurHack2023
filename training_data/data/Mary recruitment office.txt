JOHN CLEESE:
Sketch just starting, actor wanted.

ERIC IDLE:
Good morning.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Morning, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
I'd like to join the army please.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I see. Short service or long service commission, sir?

ERIC IDLE:
As long as possible please.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Right well I'll just take a few particulars and then...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Shove off!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Then there'll be a few forms to sign, and of course we'll need references and then a full medical examination by the ...

ERIC IDLE:
Yes. Yes, yes I see.

ERIC IDLE:
I was just wondering whether it would be possible for me to join... the women's army?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
The Women's Royal Army Corps, sir?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes. I was just thinking, you know, if it was possible for me to have my choice ... I'd prefer to be in the Women's Royal Amy Corps.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, I'm afraid that the people that recruit here normally go straight into the Scots Guards.

ERIC IDLE:
Which is all... men... I suppose?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes it is.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes. Are there any regiments which are more effeminate than others?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, no sir. I mean, apart from the Marines, they're all dead butch.

ERIC IDLE:
You see, what I really wanted was a regiment where I could be really quiet and have more time to myself to work with fabrics, and creating new concepts in interior design.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Working with fabrics and experimenting with interior design!

ERIC IDLE:
Yes.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh well you want the Durham Light Infantry then, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh yes. That's the only regiment that's really doing something new with interior design, with colour, texture, line and that.

ERIC IDLE:
I see.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh yes, I mean their use of colour with fabrics is fantastic. I saw their pattern book the other day - beautiful, beautiful. Savage tans, great slabs of black set against aggressive orange. It really makes you want to shout out, this is good! This is real!

ERIC IDLE:
Really?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh yes. I mean the Inniskillin Fusiliers and the Anglian Regiment are all right if you're interested in the art nouveau William Morris revival bit, but if you really want a regiment of the line that is really saying something about interior decor, then you've got to go for the Durham Light Infantry.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, I've had enough of this. I'm handing in my notice.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What do you mean?

ERIC IDLE:
Well I mean, when I applied for this job I thought I'd get a few decent lines but you end up doing the whole thing. I mean my last five speeches have been 'really, really - I see - I see' and 'really'. I wouldn't give those lines to a dog.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
All right, all right, all right, sonny. I'll tell you what. We'll do something different. I'll be a bus conductor, and you can be a really funny passenger on a bus.
