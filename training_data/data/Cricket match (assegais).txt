MICHAEL PALIN:
Warwickshire had dismissed the Kalahari Batsmen for 140, and then it was their turn to face this extraordinary Kalahari attack. Pratt was the first to go, but Pratt and Pratt put on a second wicket stand of nought, which was broken by Odinga in his most hostile mood.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Thats B. Pratt, hit wicket - 0. But Pratt and Z. Pratt dug in and took the score to a half...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Typical of Umbonga's hostile opening spell was his dismissal of V.E. Pratt, who offered no resistance to this delivery...

MICHAEL PALIN:
... and he was caught behind.

MICHAEL PALIN:
But by lunch the situation had changed dramatically.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And so with the tension colossal as we come up to the last ball ... that's all from us.
