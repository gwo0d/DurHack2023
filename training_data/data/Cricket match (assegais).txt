MICHAEL PALIN:
Warwickshire had dismissed the Kalahari Batsmen for 140, and then it was their turn to face this extraordinary Kalahari attack. Pratt was the first to go, but Pratt and Pratt put on a second wicket stand of nought, which was broken by Odinga in his most hostile mood.

DIRECTION:
A compilation of the day's play. Natives in normal cricket gear. Pratt at crease as per usual cricket coverage. Cut to a low shot of the bowler thundering up towards the wicket. Cut away to the batsman preparing to take the shot. Cut back to the bowler. As he reaches the crease he produces a spear and raises it to shoulder height and hurls it. Cut to batsman who is hit full in the stomach. His bat dislodges the bails. There is a 'howzat' from all the native fielders. He makes an annoyed gesture as if he were Colin Cowdrey caught clean bowled, and sinks to the ground.

DIRECTION:
CAPTION: 'B. RATT'

MICHAEL PALIN:
Thats B. Pratt, hit wicket - 0. But Pratt and Z. Pratt dug in and took the score to a half...

DIRECTION:
cut to the new batting partnership; B. Pratt's body is still on the ground

DIRECTION:
Z. Pratt reaching the pavilion, running with a hail of spears and arrows coming after him

DIRECTION:
cut to M.J.K. Pratt coming out pulling on gloves etc.

DIRECTION:
he reaches the crease and takes guard, the bowler bowls

DIRECTION:
a huge spear sticks right through the lower part of his leg; they appeal and he turns and limps manfully off

DIRECTION:
CAPTION: 'M.J.K. PRATT'

MICHAEL PALIN:
Typical of Umbonga's hostile opening spell was his dismissal of V.E. Pratt, who offered no resistance to this delivery...

DIRECTION:
cut to native bowler bowling a machete; it hits the ground and does a leg spin up, slicing off the batsman's head as he waves his bat

MICHAEL PALIN:
... and he was caught behind.

DIRECTION:
The batsman's severed head lands in the wicket keeper's gloves. He throws it in the air with a flourish.

DIRECTION:
CAPTION: 'V.E. PRATT'

DIRECTION:
Jeremy Thorpe appears and waves.

DIRECTION:
Cut to the presenter from 'World' s Most Awful Family 1974'.

MICHAEL PALIN:
But by lunch the situation had changed dramatically.

DIRECTION:
Cut back to the presenter. Behind him the 'Worlds Most Awful Family' sign is crossed out and replaced with 'Sport'.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And so with the tension colossal as we come up to the last ball ... that's all from us.

DIRECTION:
Roll credits on black background. The first part of the signature tune is played very hesitantly on guitar.
