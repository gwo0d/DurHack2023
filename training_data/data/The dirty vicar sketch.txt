Cut to two ladies taking tea in an Edwardian drawing room.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Have you seen Lady Windermere's new carriage, dear?

CARON GARDENER:
Absolutely enchanting!

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Isn't it!

DIRECTION:
Chivers the butler enters.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
The new vicar to see you, m'lady.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Send him in, Chivers.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Certainly, m'lady.

DIRECTION:
he goes

DIRECTION:
Enter a Swiss mountaineer (Terry G) in Tyrolean hat, lederhosen, haversack, icepick, etc. Followed by two men in evening dress. They look round and exit.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Now, how is your tea, dear? A little more water perhaps?

DIRECTION:
Thank you. It is delightful as it is.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
The Reverend Ronald Simms, the Dirty Vicar of St Michael's ... ooh!

DIRECTION:
Chivers is obviously goosed from behind by the Dirty Vicar.

TERRY JONES:
Cor, what a lovely bit of stuff. I'd like to get my fingers around those knockers.

DIRECTION:
He pounces upon the second lady, throws her skirt over her head and pushes her over the back of the sofa.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
How do you find the vicarage?

DIRECTION:
The vicar stands up from behind the sofa, his shirt open and his hair awry; he reaches over and puts his hand down the first lady's front.

TERRY JONES:
I like tits!

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh vicar! vicar!

DIRECTION:
The vicar suddenly pulls back and looks around him as if in the horror of dawning realisation.

TERRY JONES:

DIRECTION:
adjusting her dress

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Yes. Never mind, never mind. Chivers - send Mary in with a new gown, will you?

DIRECTION:
The second lady struggles to her feet from behind the couch, completely dishevelled. Her own gown completely ripped open.

DIRECTION:

TERRY JONES:
I do beg your pardon ... I must sit down.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
As I was saying, how do you find the new vicarage?

DIRECTION:
They take their seats on the couch.

TERRY JONES:
Oh yes, certainly, yes indeed, I find the grounds delightful, and the servants most attentive and particularly the little serving maid with the great big knockers, and...

DIRECTION:
He throws himself on the hostess across the tea table, knocking it over and they disappear over the back of the hostess's chair. Grunts etc. Enter Dickie applauding. Also, we hear audience applause.

ERIC IDLE:
Well, there we are, another year has been too soon alas ended and I think none more than myself can be happier at this time than I ... am.

DIRECTION:
The cast of the sketch stand in a line at the back, looking awkward and smiling. Fade out.
