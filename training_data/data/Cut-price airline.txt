ERIC IDLE:
Morning sir, can I help you?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Er, yes, we've booked on your flight for America.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, we don't fly to America ...

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, the American flight... Er, on the plane ... oh yes, oh we do that, all right. Safe as houses, no need for panic.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Is it really 37/6d?

ERIC IDLE:
Thirty bob. I'm robbing myself.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Thirty bob!

ERIC IDLE:
Twenty-five. Two quid the pair of yer. Er, that's without insurance.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, how much is it with insurance?

ERIC IDLE:
Hundred and two quid. That's including the flight.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Do we really need insurance?

ERIC IDLE:
No.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, essential.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, we'll have it with insurance please.

ERIC IDLE:
Right - do you want it with the body and one relative flown back, or you can have both bodies flown back and no relatives, or four relatives, no bodies, and the ashes sent by parcel post.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
How long will it take?

ERIC IDLE:
Er, let me put it this way - no idea.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Six hours.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Six?

ERIC IDLE:
Five, ten for the pair of you.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh, is it a jet?

ERIC IDLE:
Well, no ... It's not so much of a jet, it's more your, er, Triumph Herald engine with wings.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
When are you taking off?.

ERIC IDLE:
3300 hours.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What?

ERIC IDLE:
2600 hours for the pair of you.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
What?

ERIC IDLE:
Have the injections, you won't care.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What injections?

ERIC IDLE:
Barley sugar injections. Calm you down. They're compulsory - Board of Trade. Promise.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh, I don't like the sound of injections.

ERIC IDLE:
You've got to make your mind up straight away if you're coming or not.

ERIC IDLE:
Right, you can't change your mind. I'll ring the departure lounge.

ERIC IDLE:
Hello? Two more on their way, Mrs Turpin.

TERRY JONES:
Now, the duty-free trolley is over there ... there's some lovely drop scones and there's duty-free broccoli and there's fresh eccles cakes. You're allowed two hundred each on the plane.

TERRY JONES:
The Verrifast Plane Company announce the departure of flight one to over the hills and far away. Will passengers for flight one, please assemble at gate one. Passengers are advised that there is still plenty of time to buy eccles cakes.

ERIC IDLE:
Nearly ready.

TERRY JONES:
All passengers please get ready for their barley sugar injections.

TERRY JONES:
That's Mr Kamikaze, the pilot, he's very nice really, but make sure he stays clear of battleships.

JOHN CLEESE:
There have been many stirring tales told of the sea and also some fairly uninteresting ones only marginally connected with it, like this one. Sorry, this isn't a very good announcement. Sorry.

JOHN CLEESE:
And here is the result of the 'Where to put Edward Heath's statue Competition. The winner was a Mr Ivy North who wins ten guineas and a visit to the Sailors Quarters.
