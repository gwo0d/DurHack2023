DIRECTION:
Pompous music. Mix to spinning globe and then to two men in a studio.

TERRY
JONES:
Good evening. Well, we have in the studio tonight a man who says things in a very roundabout way. Isn't that so, Mr Pudifoot.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes.

TERRY
JONES:
Have you always said things in a very roundabout way?

TERRY
JONES:
Well, I can't help noticing that, for someone who claims to say things in a very roundabout way, your last two answers have very little of the discursive quality about them.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, well, I'm not very talkative today. It's a form of defensive response to intensive interrogative stimuli. I used to get it badly when I was a boy ... well, I say very badly, in fact, do you remember when there was that fashion for, you know, little poodles with small coats...

TERRY
JONES:
Ah, now you're beginning to talk in a roundabout way.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, I'm sorry.

TERRY
JONES:
No, no, no, no. Please do carry on ... because that is in fact why we wanted you on the show.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I thought it was because you were interested in me as a human being.

DIRECTION:
gets up and leaves
