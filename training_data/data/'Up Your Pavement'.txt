DIRECTION:
A high street. Musical theme played on a banjo a la 'Steptoe and Son' opening. Cut to a tracking shot of two tramps walking jauntily along. They are very arch, over-the-top jolly fellows. They nod at the occasional passer-by and do mock bows to a city gent.

CAPTION: 'FROM AN IDEA BY LORD CARRINGTON'

DIRECTION:
They come to a litter bin, root in it, and one of them produces a newspaper. He hands it to the other, looks in again and brings out a pork pie. He looks in again, his eyes light up, and he produces a bottle of champagne. He passes it to his mate. He looks in again and finds two highly polished glasses. Meanwhile over all this and as they set off down the road together we hear:

MICHAEL PALIN:
Taking life as it comes, sharing the good things and the bad things, finding laughter and fun wherever they go - it is with these two happy-go-lucky rogues that our story begins.

DIRECTION:
by this time the tramps have walked out of shot; cut to a shot of a sports car up on the pavement with the legs of the two tramps sticking out from underneath; the music turns more urgent and transatlantic

DIRECTION:
appropriate music; a James Bond character climbs out of the car and looks down at the dead tramps

DIRECTION:
shot of him rushing into a film premiere past photographers with flashing bulbs

DIRECTION:
cut to him on yacht

DIRECTION:
still of him with Henry Kissenger; cut to him striding down a street

DIRECTION:
we see him go into a doorway; cut to a low angle close up of Dr Koning donning gloves prior to the operation; the music changes to the Kildare theme

DIRECTION:
cut to a doorbell and pan down

DIRECTION:
pan down to find the doorbell and name

DIRECTION:
the door opens and the rear-admiral comes striding out; naval music; he walks up the road

DIRECTION:
cut to a still of a young inspired and devoted nurse; the music instantly changes to the heroic

DIRECTION:
mix to impressive college grounds

DIRECTION:
zoom in across lawns towards the college building

DIRECTION:
the camera suddenly veers off away from college and homes in on a solitary bush from which appears a seedy fellow in a terrible lightweight suit of several years ago that has got all stained and creased around the crutch

MICHAEL PALIN:
Len Hanky! Chiropodist, voyeur, hen-teaser. The man of whom the chairman of Fiat once said...

DIRECTION:
Cut to a high-powered Italian businessman at a desk in a very modern casa-type Italian office.

ERIC IDLE:
Che cosa Ã¨ lo succiacatori do polli?

DIRECTION:
SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: What is a hen-teaser?

DIRECTION:
The phone rings. He answers it dynamically and we zoom in on his tense, alert, executive face.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes! Tonight we examine the career of Gino Agnelli! The man who started from nothing to build up one of the greatest firms in Europe.

DIRECTION:
mix through to stock film of a big car-producing plant

DIRECTION:
as each of these things is mentioned we see a momentary flash of a still of each

DIRECTION:
at this point the freeze frame starts moving as the chaplain lifts himself out of the cockpit and jumps down beside his Spitfire

DIRECTION:
smiling cheerfully he crosses off another emblem of a vicar in a German helmet on the side of the plane. Beside this is written '"Here we come Kraut" Luke 17, verse 3'

DIRECTION:
a squadron leader, just off a mission, runs past, and dashes into a Nissen hut
