ERIC IDLE:
Good evening, and welcome to the Arthur Ludlow Memorial Baths, Newport, for this year's finals of the All-England Summarize Proust Competition.

ERIC IDLE:
Alec and Eric Bedser, ex-Surrey cricketers, Stewart Surridge, ex-captain of Surrey, Omar Sharif, Laurie Fishlock, ex-Surrey opening batsman, Peter May, the former Surrey and England Captain, and Yehudi Menuhin, the world-famous violinist and the President of the Surrey Cricket Club. And right now it's time to meet your host for tonight Arthur Mee!

TERRY JONES:
Good evening and welcome, whereas Proust would say, 'la malade imaginaire de recondition et de toute surveillance est bientôt la même chose'.

TERRY JONES:
.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Proust's novel ostensibly tells of the irrevocability of time lost, the forfeiture of innocence through experience, the reinstallment of extra-temporal values of time regained, ultimately the novel is both optimistic and set within the context of a humane religious experience, re-stating as it does the concept of intemporality. In the first volume, Swarm, the family friend visits...

TERRY JONES:
Well tried, Harry.

ERIC IDLE:
A good attempt there but unfortunately he chose a general appraisal of the work, before getting on to the story and as you can see

ERIC IDLE:
he only got as far as page one of 'Swarm's Way', the first of the seven volumes. A good try though and very nice posture.

TERRY JONES:
Harry Bagot, you're from Luton?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, Arthur, yeah.

TERRY JONES:
Now Harry what made you first want to try and start summarizing Proust?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well I first entered a seaside Summarizing Proust Competition when I was on holiday in Bournemouth, and my doctor encouraged me with it.

TERRY JONES:
And Harry, what are your hobbies outside summarizing?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, strangling animals, golf and masturbating.

TERRY JONES:
Well, thank you Harry Bagot.

ERIC IDLE:
Well there he goes. Harry Bagot. He must have let himself down a bit on the hobbies, golf's not very popular around here, but never mind, a good try.

TERRY JONES:
Thank you ladies and gentlemen. Mr Rutherford from Leicester, are you ready Ronald?

TERRY JONES:
Right. On the summarizing spot. You have got fifteen seconds from now.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Er, well, Swann, Swann, there's this house, there's this house, and er, it's in the morning, it's in the morning - no, it's the evening, in the evening and er, there's a garden and er, this bloke comes in - bloke comes in - what's his name - what's his name, er just said it - big bloke - Swann, Swann

TERRY JONES:
And now ladies and gentlemen, I'd like you to welcome the last of our all-England finalists this evening, from Bingley, the Bolton Choral Society and their leader Superintendent McGough,

TERRY JONES:
All right Bingley, remember you've got fifteen seconds to summarize Proust in his entirety starting from now.

ERIC IDLE:
Very ambitious try there, but in fact the least successful of the evening, they didn't even get as far as the first volume.

TERRY JONES:
Well ladies and gentlemen, I don't think any of our contestants this evening have succeeded in encapsulating the intricacies of Proust's masterwork, so I'm going to award the first prize this evening to the girl with the biggest tits.
