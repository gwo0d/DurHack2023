MICHAEL PALIN:
Hello, are you a hermit by any chance?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes that's right. Are you a hermit?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, I certainly am.

ERIC IDLE:
Well I never. What are you getting away from?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh you know, the usual - people, chat, gossip, you know.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh I certainly do - it was the same with me. I mean there comes a time when you realize there's no good frittering your life away in idleness and trivial chit-chat. Where's your cave?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, up the goat track, first on the left.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh they're very nice up there, aren't they?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes they are, I've got a beauty.

ERIC IDLE:
A bit drafty though, aren't they?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, we've had ours insulated.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh yes.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, I used birds' nests, moss and oak leaves round the outside.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, sounds marvellous.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh it's a treat, it really is, 'cos otherwise those stone caves can be so grim.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes they really can be, can't they? They really can.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh yes.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Morning Frank.

ERIC IDLE:
Morning Norman. Talking of moss, er you know Mr Robinson?

MICHAEL PALIN:
With the, er, green loin cloth?

ERIC IDLE:
Er no, that's Mr Seagrave. Mr Robinson's the hermit who lodges with Mr Seagrave.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh I see, yes.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes well he's put me onto wattles.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Really?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes. Swears by them. Yes.

JOHN CLEESE:
Morning Frank.

ERIC IDLE:
Morning Lionel. Well he says that moss tends to fall off the cave walls during cold weather. You know you might get a really bad spell and half the moss drops off the cave wall, leaving you cold.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh well, Mr Robinson's cave's never been exactly nirvana has it?

ERIC IDLE:
Well, quite, that's what I mean. Anyway, Mr Rogers, he's the, er, hermit...

MICHAEL PALIN:
... on the end.

ERIC IDLE:
. .. up at the top, yes. Well he tried wattles and he came out in a rash.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, and there's me with half a wall wattled, I mean what'll I do?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well why don't you try birds nests like I've done? Or else, dead bracken.

TERRY JONES:
Frank!

ERIC IDLE:
Yes Han.

TERRY JONES:
Can I borrow your goat?

ERIC IDLE:
Er, yes that'll be all right. Oh leave me a pint for breakfast will you? ...

ERIC IDLE:
You see, you know that is the trouble with living half way up a cliff - you feel so cut off. You know it takes me two hours every morning to get out onto the moors, collect my berries, chastise myself, and two hours back in the evening.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Still there's one thing about being a hermit, at least you meet people.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh yes, I wouldn't go back to public relations.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh well, bye for now Frank, must toddle.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Right, you two hermits, stop that sketch. I think it's silly.

ERIC IDLE:
What?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It's silly.

ERIC IDLE:
What do you mean, you can't stop it - it's on film.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
That doesn't make any difference to the viewer at home, does it? Come on, get out. Out. Come on out, all of you. Get off, go on, all of you. Go on, move, move. Go on, get out. Come on, get out, move, move.
