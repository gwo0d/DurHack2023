MICHAEL PALIN:
This is Ken Clean-Air Systems, the great white hope of the British boxing world. After three fights - and only two convictions - his manager believes that Ken is now ready to face the giant American, Satellite Five.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
The great thing about Ken is that he's almost totally stupid.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Every morning, he jogs the forty-seven miles from his two-bedroomed, eight-bathroom, six-up-two-down, three-to-go-house in Reigate, to the Government's Pesticide Research Centre at Shoreham. Nobody knows why.

ERIC IDLE:
Basically Ken is a very gentle, home-loving person. I remember when one of his stick insects had a knee infection. He stayed up all night rubbing it with germoline and banging its head on the table.

TERRY JONES:
Oh he was such a pretty baby, always so kind and gentle. He was really considerate to his mother, and not at all the kind of person you'd expect to pulverize their opponent into a bloody mass of flesh and raw bone, spitting teeth and fragments of gum into a ring which had become one man's hell and Ken's glory.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Every morning at his little three-room semi near Reading, Ken gets up at three o'dock

MICHAEL PALIN:
and goes back to bed again because it's far too early.

MICHAEL PALIN:
At seven o'clock Ken gets up, he has a quick shower, a rub-down, gets into his track-suit, and goes back to bed again.

MICHAEL PALIN:
At 7.50 every morning Ken's trainer runs the 13,000 miles from his two-room lean-to in Bangkok and gets him up.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I used to wake Ken up with a crowbar on the back of the head. But I recently found that this was too far from his brain and I wasn't getting through to him anymore. So I now wake him up with a steel peg driven into his skull with a mallet.

MICHAEL PALIN:
For breakfast every day, Ken places a plate of liver and bacon under his chair, and locks himself in the cupboard.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, he's having a lot of mental difficulties with his breakfasts, but this is temperament, caused by a small particle of brain in his skull, and once we've removed that he'll be perfectly all right.

MICHAEL PALIN:
At 8.30 the real training begins.

MICHAEL PALIN:
At 10.30 every morning Ken arrives at what he thinks is the gym. Sometimes it's a sweetshop, sometimes it's a private house. Today its a hospital.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Urn, straight down there. Straight down there.

MICHAEL PALIN:
For lunch Ken crouches down in the road and rubs gravel into his hair.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hello. When Ken is in a really deep sleep like this one, the only way to wake him up is to saw his head off.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What is he like in the ring, this human dynamo, this eighteen-stone bantam weight battering-ram? We asked his sparring partner and one-time childhood sweetheart, Maureen Spencer.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Well, I think that if Ken keeps his right up, gets in with the left jab and takes the fight to his man - well, he should go for a cut eye in the third and put Wilcox on the canvas by six.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ken's opponent in Tuesday's fight is Petula Wilcox, the Birmingham girl who was a shorthand typist before turning pro in 1968.

MICHAEL PALIN:
She's keen on knitting and likes Cliff Richard records. How does she rate her chances against Ken?

CONNIE BOOTH:
Well, I'm a southpaw and I think this will confuse him, particularly with his brain problem.

MICHAEL PALIN:
My lords, ladies and gedderbong... On my right, from the town of Reigate in the county of Kent, the heavyweight...

MICHAEL PALIN:
and on my left! Miss Petula Wilcox.

JOHN CLEESE:
I think boxing's a splendid sport - teaches you self-defense.

TERRY JONES:
Obviously boxing must have its limits, but providing they're both perfectly fit I can see nothing wrong with one healthy man beating the living daylights out of a little schoolgirl.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, no, he's gone. But he left a message. Jack! Where's that note that fellow left?

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, here you are.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It says sorry, had to catch the last bus. Am on the 49b to Babbacombe.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, er, there you are. Hello. You got the note, jolly good. Well, um, that's all the items that we have for you this week and er, what a jolly nice lot of items too, eh? Um...well, the same team will be back with you again next week with another menu full of items. Um...I don't know if I shall be introducing the show next week as I understand my bits in this show have not been recieved quite as well as they might

JOHN CLEESE:
Sorry. I do beg your pardon. I don't like these...displays of emotion...I wish it would say the end.
