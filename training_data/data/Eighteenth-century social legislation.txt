DIRECTION:
Cut to fantastically alluring boudoir: a plush four poster bed with silk drapes, silk sheets, a fur pillow etc. We look down on it from above. Stretched out on the bed is a girl (Carol) oozing with sex... a real professional... black net stocking, suspenders, bra and panties or what have you. She moves as if in the throes of orgasm as she mimes to a very masculine voice off.

very masculine voice to which girl mimes

JOHN CLEESE:
Good evening. Tonight I want to examine the whole question of eighteenth-century social legislation - its relevance to the hierarchical structure of post-Renaissance society, and its impact on the future of parochial organization in an expanding agrarian economy. But first a bit of fun.

DIRECTION:
Cut to film of eight-second striptease. Cut immediately back to the same set.

JOHN CLEESE:
To put England's social legislation in a European context is Professor Gert Van Der Whoops of the Rijksmuseum in the Hague.

DIRECTION:
Cut to another bed, equally seductive. A little bespectcled professor is lying on it being caressed and undressed by an amorous siren.

DIRECTION:
A curtain and potted palms. Sound effects: angel choirs. A man in dinner jacket with angel's wings on is lowered from above. As he touches the ground the angel choirs fade out. He gets a crumpled piece of paper out of his pocket.

TERRY JONES:
And now Professor R.J. Canning.

DIRECTION:
He folds up the paper and puts it away. The angel choirs start again and he slowly rises up and out of frame.

DIRECTION:
Cut to Professor Canning in straight presentation-type set with BP screen behind him.
