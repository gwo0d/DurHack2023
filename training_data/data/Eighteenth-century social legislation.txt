JOHN CLEESE:
Good evening. Tonight I want to examine the whole question of eighteenth-century social legislation - its relevance to the hierarchical structure of post-Renaissance society, and its impact on the future of parochial organization in an expanding agrarian economy. But first a bit of fun.

JOHN CLEESE:
To put England's social legislation in a European context is Professor Gert Van Der Whoops of the Rijksmuseum in the Hague.

TERRY JONES:
And now Professor R.J. Canning.
