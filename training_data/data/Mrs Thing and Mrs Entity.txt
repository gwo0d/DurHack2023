DIRECTION:
Fade out. Fade into a bench in a public park, garden or square. A pepperpot is sitting on the bench. Another pepperpot comes by pushing a shopping trolley.

ERIC IDLE:
Hello, Mrs Thing.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Hello, Mrs Entity.

ERIC IDLE:
How are you then?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, I have had a morning.

ERIC IDLE:
Busy?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Busy - huh! I got up at five o'dock, I made myself a cup of tea, I looked out of the window. Well, by then I was so worn out I had to come and have a sit-down. I've been here for seven hours.

ERIC IDLE:
You must be exhausted.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Mm. Oh, have you been shopping?

ERIC IDLE:
No, I've been shopping.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Funny.

ERIC IDLE:
I'm worn out. I've been shopping for six hours.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What have you bought, then?

ERIC IDLE:
Nothing. Nothing at all. A complete waste of time.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Wicked, isn't it?

ERIC IDLE:
Wicked. It'll be worse when we join the Common Market.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
That nice Mr Heath would never allow that.

ERIC IDLE:
It's funny he never married.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
He's a bachelor.

ERIC IDLE:
Oooh! That would explain it, Oh dear me, this chatting away wears me out.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes. I bet Mrs Reginald Maudling doesn't have to put up with all this drudgery, getting up at five in the morning, making a cup of tea, looking out of the window, chatting away.

ERIC IDLE:
No! It'd all be done for her.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, she'd have the whole day free for playing snooker.

ERIC IDLE:
She probably wouldn't go through all the drudgery of playing snooker, day in, day out.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, it would all be done for her. She wouldn't even have to lift the cue.

ERIC IDLE:
She probably doesn't even know where the billlard room is.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, still, it's not as bad as the old days. Mrs Stanley Baldwin used to have to get up at five o'clock in the morning and go out and catch partridges with her bare hands.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes... and Mrs William Pitt the Elder used to have to get up at three o'clock and go burrowing for truffles with the bridge of her nose.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Mrs Beethoven used to have to get up at midnight to spur on the mynah bird.

ERIC IDLE:
Lazy creatures, mynah birds,..

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes. When Beethoven went deaf the mynah bird just used to mime.

DIRECTION:
The picture begins to wobble as in flashback; appropriate dreamy music effect.

DIRECTION:
looking at camera

ERIC IDLE:
Ooh! What's happening?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It's all right. It's only a flashback.
