ERIC IDLE:
... Titty was very worried. Where could Mary be? He looked everywhere. Under the stones and behind the bushes... and Mr Squirrel helped him by looking up in the trees, and Mr Badger helped him by looking under the ground...

ERIC IDLE:
... and so, Your Majesty, we the Commons do herein crave and beseech that...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Enter!

TERRY JONES:
Your Majesty... Louis XVIII is here!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Who is Louis XVIII?

TERRY JONES:
The King of France, Your Majesty! This is a great moment to have, sir.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
There is no Louis XVIII.

TERRY JONES:
He craves Your Majesty's pardon. He has had a long journey here and miscounted... He is Louis XVII.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Louis XVI is dead already?

TERRY JONES:
Aaaaaaaaaaaaghh! Oh my God! Oh... ah... oh Christ!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Your Majesty... I am Louis XVI as you so rightly say, and I don't want to muck about. I have a wee proposition which could make the name of George IV the most respected in Europe...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
George

MICHAEL PALIN:
George III! Sorry. Where can we talk?

TERRY JONES:
Oh! God! ... did you see that?... Oh!... aaaargh! Oh dear!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
We shall have a state banquet at St James' Palace!

MICHAEL PALIN:
No no, look, I can't hang about. It's take it or leave... we got to get back to... er...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Paris, by tonight...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Must you leave us, Louis?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'd rather just sell the plans and nip off, Georgie boy.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
All right... we will buy the plans... if you will undertake to disengage your troops in America.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Do what?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
And, I shall give you £10,000 for the plans...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ten thousand

MICHAEL PALIN:
! Right, well, we'll disengage the, urn, you know... like you said - we'll disengage 'em... tell you what, then, I'll put a duke on to it... OK? Right!

TERRY JONES:
That's the worst thing you can do to anybody.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You asked for it, sonny.

TERRY JONES:
You could have broken my bloody nose!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
North! Please!

TERRY JONES:
You saw it! It was right on the bone.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
North! Will you send for the Duke of Portland ... we have a financial matter to discuss.

TERRY JONES:
Well, it really hurt.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, look, I think it's better if you give the money to us. We're going back. We've got a bag.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no... don't worry, Louis. We shall talk to your Monsieur Necker.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah! Well, actually, we'd rather you didn't... we've been having a wee bit of trouble with him... you know what I mean?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Monsieur Necker? The man who introduced so many valuable reforms and who proved so popular despite his opposition to Mirabeau's policy of issuing 'assignats'?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Er... aye, yeah... the trouble is he's been drinking a bit recently ... you' know, fourteen lagers with his breakfast... that sort of thing.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well... very well, Louis...

TERRY JONES:
Just a moment!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, Christ!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What are you doing?

TERRY JONES:
I am Joseph Montgolfier, the inventor of the fire balloon. The man before you is an impostor!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ooh! I am not ... honestly!

TERRY JONES:
No, not you, Your Majesty

TERRY JONES:
This man - this Louis, the so-called King of France man. Which number did you give this time - Louis the 23rd?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I got it right!

TERRY JONES:
I bet you took a few guesses.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Listen, you spotty sassenach pillock..

TERRY GILLIAM:
Your Majesty! The Ronettes are here.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh dear, I'm not supposed to go mad till 1800!

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Joseph has been gone for six months now ... we have heard nothing!

ERIC IDLE:
He can look after himself.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
But he had only on a towel, you know.

ERIC IDLE:
Antoinette... from now on there is only one Montgolfier brother.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
But Louis XIV has the plans... you must wait until Joseph returns.

ERIC IDLE:
Let me put my tongue in your mouth.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
What do you mean?

ERIC IDLE:
We're supposed to be French, aren't we?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
No, I mean what are the plans which Joseph after is chasing?

ERIC IDLE:
Please, let me put it in a little way.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh, Jacques, ze

CAROL CLEVELAND:
!

ERIC IDLE:
I take it out if you don't like it.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Are you sure the claret was on the left of the sideboard, sir?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, O'Toole, it's always been there.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well I'll look for one more month, sir.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
By the way sir, Mr Bartlett has gone, sir. He said he couldn't wait any longer.

ERIC IDLE:
Thank you, O'Toole...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Not at all, sir... I've enjoyed being in it...

ERIC IDLE:
Right!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Thank you, sir... mam'selle.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
By the way, sir, Mr Bartlett has gone, sir.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
He said he couldn't wait any longer, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
Thank you, O'Toole.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Not at all, sir ... I've enjoyed being in it.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Thank you, sir ... mam'selle.

MICHAEL PALIN:
George III was arranged and composed by Neil Innes. He is available from the BBC price £4 or eight months' imprisonment.
