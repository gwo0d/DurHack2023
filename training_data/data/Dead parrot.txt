JOHN CLEESE:
Hello, I wish to register a complaint...Hello? Miss?

MICHAEL PALIN:
What do you mean, miss?

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh I'm sorry, I have a cold. I wish to make a complaint!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Sorry, we're closing for lunch.

JOHN CLEESE:
Never mind that, my lad. I wish to complain about this parrot what I purchased not half an hour ago from this very boutique.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh yes, the, the Norwegian Blue. What's wrong with it?

JOHN CLEESE:
I'll tell you what's wrong with it, my lad. It's dead, that's what's wrong with it!

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, no, it's resting, look!

JOHN CLEESE:
Look my lad, I know a dead parrot when I see one, and I'm looking at one right now.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No no sir. it's not dead. It's resting!

JOHN CLEESE:
Resting?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yeah, remarkable bird, the Norwegian Blue, beautiful plumage, innit?

JOHN CLEESE:
The plumage don't enter into it - it's stone dead.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, no - it's just resting!

JOHN CLEESE:
All right then, if it's restin', I'll wake him up!

JOHN CLEESE:
Hello Polly! I've got a nice cuttlefish for you when you wake up, Polly Parrot!

MICHAEL PALIN:
There, it moved!

JOHN CLEESE:
No, he didn't. That was you pushing the cage!

MICHAEL PALIN:
I did not.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, you did!

JOHN CLEESE:
Now that's what I call a dead parrot.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, no. It's stunned.

JOHN CLEESE:
Look my lad, I've had just about enough of this. That parrot is definitely deceased. And when I bought it not half an hour ago, you assured me that its lack of movement was due to it being tired and shagged out after a long squawk.

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's probably pining for the fjords.

JOHN CLEESE:
Pining for the fjords, what kind of talk is that? Look, why did it fall flat on its back the moment I got it home?

MICHAEL PALIN:
The Norwegian Blue prefers kipping on it's back! Beautiful bird, lovely plumage!

JOHN CLEESE:
Look, I took the liberty of examining that parrot, and I discovered the only reason that it had been sitting on its perch in the first place was that it had been nailed there.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well of course it was nailed there. Otherwise it would muscle up to those bars and voom.

JOHN CLEESE:
Look matey

JOHN CLEESE:
this parrot wouldn't voom if you put four thousand volts through it! It's bleedin' demised!

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's not, it's pining!

JOHN CLEESE:
It's not pining, it's passed on. This parrot is no more! It has ceased to be. It's expired and gone to meet its maker.This is a late parrot. It's a stiff. Bereft of life, it rests in peace. If you hadn't nailed it to the perch it would be pushing up the daisies. It's rung down the curtain and joined the choir invisible. This is an ex-parrot.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, I'd better replace it, then.

JOHN CLEESE:
If you want to get anything done in this country you've got to complain till you're blue in the mouth.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Sorry guv, we're right out of parrots.

JOHN CLEESE:
I see. I see. I get the picture.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I got a slug.

JOHN CLEESE:
Does it talk?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Not really, no.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, it's scarcely a replacement, then is it?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Listen, I'll tell you what,

MICHAEL PALIN:
tell you what, if you go to my brother's pet shop in Bolton he'll replace your parrot for you.

JOHN CLEESE:
Bolton eh?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yeah.

JOHN CLEESE:
All right.

JOHN CLEESE:
Er, excuse me. This is Bolton, is it?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, no it's, er, Ipswich.

JOHN CLEESE:
I wish to make a complaint.

TERRY JONES:
I don't have to do this, you know.

JOHN CLEESE:
I beg your pardon.

TERRY JONES:
I'm a qualified brain surgeon. I only do this because I like being my own boss.

JOHN CLEESE:
Er, excuse me, this is irrelevant, isn't it.

TERRY JONES:
Oh yeah, it's not easy to pad these out to thirty minutes.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well I wish to make a complaint. I got on the Bolton train and found myself deposited here in Ipswich.

TERRY JONES:
No, this is Bolton.

JOHN CLEESE:
The pet shop owner's brother was lying.

TERRY JONES:
Well you can't blame British Rail for that.

JOHN CLEESE:
If this is Bolton, I shall return to the pet shop.

JOHN CLEESE:
I understand that this

JOHN CLEESE:
Bolton.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, you told me it was Ipswich.

MICHAEL PALIN:
It was a pun.

JOHN CLEESE:
A pun?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, no, not a pun, no. What's the other thing which reads the same backwards as forwards?

JOHN CLEESE:
A palindrome?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, yes.

JOHN CLEESE:
It's not a palindrome. The palindrome of Bolton would be Notlob. It don't work.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Look, what do you want.

JOHN CLEESE:
No I'm sorry, I'm not prepared to pursue my line of enquiry any further as I think this is getting too silly.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Quite agree. Quite agree. Silly. Silly...silly. Right get on with it. Get on with it.
