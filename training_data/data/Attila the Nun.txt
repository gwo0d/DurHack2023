JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, it's Attila the Nun.

DIRECTION:
Attila the Nun flashes past the camera, There is a loud sound of the bike crashing off camera.

MICHAEL PALIN:
A simple country girl who took a vow of eternal brutality.

DIRECTION:
Attila the Nun on a hospital bed, struggling wildly with two doctors and a nurse who are trying to hold her down. She looks really fearsome. Another doctor enters and summons the nurse away.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Nurse!

DIRECTION:
The camera tracks away and comes up on another bed in which is sitting a beautiful girl revealing more than a patient normally would and endowed with Carol's . . . undoubted attributes. Screens are placed around her. The doctor and nurse come in through the screens.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Hello, Miss Norris. How are you?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Not too bad, thank you, doctor.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, well I think I'd better examine you.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a line of half a dozen shabby men in filthy macs down to the floor and caps, who shuffle in through the screens and stand at the foot of the bed leering.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
What are they doing here?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It's all right, they're students. Um... lights please, nurse.

DIRECTION:
a single red spotlight spills down on the girl; cut back to the men leering

DIRECTION:
nurse presses a switch beside bed; stripper music; very loud; cut to line of men getting very exalted - hands deep in pockets

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Breathe in ... out ... in ... out...

DIRECTION:
After about five seconds the music reaches a climax and ends. The men in macs all applaud.
