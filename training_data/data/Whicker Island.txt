CAPTION: 'WHICKER'S WORLD'

DIRECTION:
Various Whickers pace past the camera.

ERIC IDLE:
Today we look at a vanishing race. A problem people who are fast disappearing off the face of the earth.

TERRY JONES:
A race who one might say are losing a winning battle.

MICHAEL PALIN:
They live in a sunshine paradise, a Caribbean dream, where only reality is missing.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
For this is Whicker Island.

JOHN CLEESE:
An island inhabited entirely by ex-international interviewers in pursuit of the impossible dream.

ERIC IDLE:
The whole problem of Whicker Island is here in a nutshell.

TERRY JONES:
There are just too many Whickers.

MICHAEL PALIN:
The light-weight suits.

The old school tie.

TERRY JONES:
There just aren't enough rich people left to interview.

TERRY JONES:
I talked to the island's only white man, Father Pierre.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a different location. Feeling of heat. The third Whicker stands beside a priest in a white robe.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Father Pierre, why did you stay on in this colonial Campari-land where the clink of glasses mingles with the murmur of a million mosquitoes, where waterfalls of whisky wash away the worries of a world-weary Whicker, where gin and tonic jingle in a gyroscopic jubilee of something beginning with J - Father Pierre, why did you stay on here?

DIRECTION:
putting on a pair of Whicker-style glasses

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well mainly for the interviews.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well there you have it, a crumbling...

ERIC IDLE:
... empire in the sun-drenched...

TERRY JONES:
Caribbean, where the clich√©s sparkle on the waters...

MICHAEL PALIN:
... like the music of repeat fees...

ERIC IDLE:
And so...

JOHN CLEESE:
... from Whicker Island...

ERIC IDLE:
