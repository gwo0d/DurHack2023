ERIC IDLE:
Vera ... Vera ... darling! Wake up my little lemon. Come to my arms.

TERRY JONES:
Maurice! What are you doing here?

ERIC IDLE:
I could not keep away from you. I must have you all the time.

TERRY JONES:
Oh this is most inconvenient.

ERIC IDLE:
Don't talk to me about convenience, love consumes my naughty mind, I'm delirious with desire.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What's that, Vera?

TERRY JONES:
Oh nothing, dear. Just a trick of the light.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Righto.

TERRY JONES:
Phew! That was close.

ERIC IDLE:
Now then my little banana, my little fruit salad, I can wait for you no longer. You must be mine utterly...

TERRY JONES:
Oh, Maurice!

JOHN CLEESE:
Vera! How dare you!

TERRY JONES:
Roger!

JOHN CLEESE:
What's the meaning of this?

TERRY JONES:
Oh I can explain everything, my darling!

JOHN CLEESE:
Who is this?

TERRY JONES:
This is Maurice Zatapathique ... Roger Thompson ... Roger Thompsnn ... Maurice Zatapathique.

ERIC IDLE:
How do you do.

JOHN CLEESE:
How do you do ...

JOHN CLEESE:
How could you do this to me, Vera ... after all we've been through? Dammit, I love you.

ERIC IDLE:
Vera! Don't you understand, it's me that loves you.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What's happening, Vera?

TERRY JONES:
Oh, nothing dear. Just a twig brushing against the window.

JOHN CLEESE:
Come to me Vera!

TERRY JONES:
Oh ... not now, Roger.

ERIC IDLE:
Vera, my little hedgehog! Don't turn me away!

TERRY JONES:
Oh it cannot be, Maurice.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Hands off, you filthy bally froggie!

TERRY JONES:
Oh Ken, Ken Biggles!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, Algy's here as well.

TERRY JONES:
Algy Braithwaite?

IAN DAVIDSON:
That's right... Vera ...

IAN DAVIDSON:
he chokes back the tears

IAN DAVIDSON:
Oh God you know we both still bally love you.

TERRY JONES:
Oh Biggles! Algy. Oh, but how wonderful!

TERRY JONES:
Oh, er, nothing dear. It's just the toilet filling up.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes ... right and right again.

TERRY JONES:
Oh. The Herman Rodrigues Four!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Vera!

MICHAEL PALIN:
I distinctly heard a Mexican rhythm combo.

TERRY JONES:
Oh no, dear... it was just the electric blanket switching off.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hm. Well I'm going for a tinkle.

TERRY JONES:
Oh no you can't do that. Here, we haven't finished the sketch yet!

JOHN CLEESE:
I say. There's no one to react to.

ERIC IDLE:
Don't talk to the camera.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh sorry.

TERRY JONES:
Here it's no good you coming in ... He's gone and left the sketch.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, he went for a tinkle.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Sh! I think my wife is beginning to suspect something...
