DIRECTION:
Cut to bedroom of a middle-aged, middle-class wealthy couple. It is dark. They are both lying fast asleep on their backs. The husband is a colonel type with a moustache. The wife has her hair in curlers and face cream on. Someone climbs in through the window and pads across to the wife. He is a dapper little Frenchman in a beret and carrying a fench loaf. He kisses her on the forehead. She wakes.

ERIC IDLE:
Vera ... Vera ... darling! Wake up my little lemon. Come to my arms.

TERRY JONES:
Maurice! What are you doing here?

ERIC IDLE:
I could not keep away from you. I must have you all the time.

TERRY JONES:
Oh this is most inconvenient.

ERIC IDLE:
Don't talk to me about convenience, love consumes my naughty mind, I'm delirious with desire.

DIRECTION:
He kisses her hand repeatedly. The husband wakes up with a start, sits bolt upright and looks straight ahead.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What's that, Vera?

TERRY JONES:
Oh nothing, dear. Just a trick of the light.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Righto.

DIRECTION:
he goes straight to sleep again

TERRY JONES:
Phew! That was close.

ERIC IDLE:
Now then my little banana, my little fruit salad, I can wait for you no longer. You must be mine utterly...

TERRY JONES:
Oh, Maurice!

DIRECTION:
Suddenly beside them appears a young public-school man in a check suit with a pipe.

JOHN CLEESE:
Vera! How dare you!

TERRY JONES:
Roger!

JOHN CLEESE:
What's the meaning of this?

TERRY JONES:
Oh I can explain everything, my darling!

JOHN CLEESE:
Who is this?

TERRY JONES:
This is Maurice Zatapathique ... Roger Thompson ... Roger Thompsnn ... Maurice Zatapathique.

ERIC IDLE:
How do you do.

JOHN CLEESE:
How do you do ...

DIRECTION:
kneeling

JOHN CLEESE:
How could you do this to me, Vera ... after all we've been through? Dammit, I love you.

ERIC IDLE:
Vera! Don't you understand, it's me that loves you.

DIRECTION:
The husband wakes up again.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What's happening, Vera?

TERRY JONES:
Oh, nothing dear. Just a twig brushing against the window.

DIRECTION:
he goes back to sleep

JOHN CLEESE:
Come to me Vera!

TERRY JONES:
Oh ... not now, Roger.

ERIC IDLE:
Vera, my little hedgehog! Don't turn me away!

TERRY JONES:
Oh it cannot be, Maurice.

DIRECTION:
Enter Biggles. He wears flying boots, jacket and helmet as for First World War. He has a notice round his neck: 'Biggles'.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Hands off, you filthy bally froggie!

DIRECTION:
kneels by the bed

TERRY JONES:
Oh Ken, Ken Biggles!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, Algy's here as well.

TERRY JONES:
Algy Braithwaite?

DIRECTION:
Into the light comes Algy. Tears streaming down his face. He wears a notice round his neck which reads: Algy's here as well.

IAN DAVIDSON:
That's right... Vera ...

IAN DAVIDSON:
he chokes back the tears

IAN DAVIDSON:
Oh God you know we both still bally love you.

TERRY JONES:
Oh Biggles! Algy. Oh, but how wonderful!

DIRECTION:
She starts to cry. Husband wakes up again.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, er, nothing dear. It's just the toilet filling up.

DIRECTION:
he goes fast asleep again

DIRECTION:
By this stage all the men have pulled up chairs in a circle around Vera's side of the bed. They are all chatting amongst themselves. Biggles is holding her hand. Maurice has produced a bottle of vin ordinaire. At this moment four Mexican musicans appear on the husband's side of the bed. The leader of the band nudges the husband, who wakes.

DIRECTION:
reading from a scruffy bit of paper

DIRECTION:
Scusey... you tell me where is ... Mrs Vera Jackson ... please.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes ... right and right again.

DIRECTION:
Muchas gracias...

DIRECTION:
He immediately goes back to sleep again. The Mexicans all troop round the bed and enter the group. The leader conducts them and they start up a little conga . . . once they've started he turns and comes over to Vera with a naughty glint in his eye. They play a guitar, a trumpet and maracas.

DIRECTION:
Oh Vera ... you remember Acapulco in the Springtime ...

TERRY JONES:
Oh. The Herman Rodrigues Four!

DIRECTION:
Suddenly the husband wakes up.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Vera!

DIRECTION:
there is immediate silence

MICHAEL PALIN:
I distinctly heard a Mexican rhythm combo.

TERRY JONES:
Oh no, dear... it was just the electric blanket switching off.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hm. Well I'm going for a tinkle.

DIRECTION:
He gets out of bed and disappears into the gloom.

TERRY JONES:
Oh no you can't do that. Here, we haven't finished the sketch yet!

DIRECTION:
Dash it all, there's only another bally page.

JOHN CLEESE:
I say. There's no one to react to.

ERIC IDLE:
Don't talk to the camera.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh sorry.

DIRECTION:
Enter a huge man dressed as an Aztec god. He stretches arms open wide and is about to speak when owing to lack of money he is cut short by Vera.

TERRY JONES:
Here it's no good you coming in ... He's gone and left the sketch.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, he went for a tinkle.

DIRECTION:
Cut to close-up of husband and a dolly bird with a lavatory chain hanging between them. She is about to pull the chain when he stops her.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Sh! I think my wife is beginning to suspect something...

DIRECTION:
Cut to animation of various strange and wonderful creatures saying to the effect:

DIRECTION:
I thought that ending was a bit predictable.

DIRECTION:
eating it

DIRECTION:
Yes indeed there was a certain lack of originality.

DIRECTION:
eating the crocodile

DIRECTION:
However it's not necessarily a good thing just to be different.

DIRECTION:
emerging from hatch in ostrich

DIRECTION:
No, quite, there is equal humour in the conventional.

DIRECTION:
eating ostrich

DIRECTION:
But on the other hand, is it what the public wants? I mean with the new permissiveness, not to mention the balance of payments. It's an undeniable fact that...

DIRECTION:
eating the pig

DIRECTION:
I agree with that completely.

DIRECTION:
That's it... let's get out of this show before it's too late...

DIRECTION:
('The End' descends on it) Too late!

DIRECTION:
Two men detatch the 'It's' man from his meat-hook and carry him off.

DIRECTION:
