JOHN CLEESE:
. Anyway, let's go straight over to James Gilbert at Leicester.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well it's a straight fight here at Leicester...On the left of the Returning Officer

MICHAEL PALIN:
and on the other side is the silly candidate Jethro Walrustitty with his agent and his wife.

TERRY JONES:
Here is the result for Leicester. Arthur J. Smith...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Sensible Party

TERRY JONES:
30,612...Jethro Q. Walrustitty...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Silly Party

TERRY JONES:
32,108.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, there's the first result and the Silly Party has held Leicester. What do you make of that, Norman?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, this is largely as I predicted, except that the Silly Party won. I think this is largely due to the number of votes cast. Gerald?

ERIC IDLE:
Well there's a swing here to the Silly Party...but how big a swing I'm not going to tell you.

TERRY JONES:
Well, if I may...I think the interesting thing here is the big swing to the Silly Party and of course the very large swing back to the Sensible Party...and a tendency to wobble up and down in the middle because the screw's loose.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, I'm afraid I can't think of anything.

TERRY GILLIAM:
I can't add anything to that. Colin?

IAN DAVIDSON:
Can I butt in at this point and say this is in fact the very first time I've appeared on television.

JOHN CLEESE:
No, no we haven't time, because we're just going straight over to Luton.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Here at Luton it's a three-cornered fight between Alan Jones - Sensible Party, in the middle, Tarquin Fin- tim- lim- bim- whin- bim- lim- bus- stop- F'tang- F'tang- Olè- Biscuitbarrel - Silly Party, and Kevin Phillips-Bong, the Slightly Silly candidate.

ERIC IDLE:
Alan Jones...

MICHAEL PALIN:
On the left, Sensible Party

ERIC IDLE:
9,112... Kevin Phillips-Bong...

MICHAEL PALIN:
On the right, Slightly Silly.

ERIC IDLE:
Nought...Tarquin Fin- tim- lin- bin- whin- bim- lin- bus- stop- F'tang- F'tang- Olé- Biscuitbarrel...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Silly.

ERIC IDLE:
12,441.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And so the Silly Party has taken Luton.

JOHN CLEESE:
A gain for the Silly Party at Luton. The first gain of the election, Norman?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well this is a highly significant result. Luton, normally a very sensible constituency with a high proportion of people who aren't a bit silly, has gone completely ga-ga.

JOHN CLEESE:
Do we have the swing at Luton?

ERIC IDLE:
Well, I've worked out the swing, but it's a secret.

JOHN CLEESE:
Er, well, ah, there...there

JOHN CLEESE:
the swing, how about a swong?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, I've got the swong here in this box and it's looking fine. I can see through the breathing holes that it's eating up peanuts at the rate of knots.

JOHN CLEESE:
And how about the swang?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, it's 29% up over six hunded feet but it's a little bit soft around the edges about...

JOHN CLEESE:
What do you make of the nylon dot cardigan and plastic mule rest?

TERRY JONES:
There's no such thing.

JOHN CLEESE:
Thank you, Spike.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Can I just come in here and say that the swong has choked itself to death.

TERRY JONES:
Well, the election's really beginning to hot up now.

TERRY GILLIAM:
I can't add anything to that.

JOHN CLEESE:
I'm sorry, Sasha, we're just about to get another result.

TERRY JONES:
Hello, from Harpenden. This is a key seat because in addition to the official Silly candidate there is an independent Very Silly candidate

TERRY JONES:
who may split the silly vote.

JOHN CLEESE:
Mrs Elsie Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...

TERRY JONES:
Silly.

JOHN CLEESE:
26,317... James Walker...

TERRY JONES:
Sensible.

JOHN CLEESE:
26,318.

TERRY JONES:
That was close.

JOHN CLEESE:
Malcolm Peter Brian Telescope Adrian Umbrella Stand Jasper Wednesday

JOHN CLEESE:
Smith.

TERRY JONES:
Very Silly.

JOHN CLEESE:
Two.

TERRY JONES:
Well there you have it. A Sensible gain at Driffield.

JOHN CLEESE:
Norman

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, I've just heard from Luton that my auntie's ill, er, possibly, possibly gastro-enteritis - Gerald.

ERIC IDLE:
Er, well, if this were repeated over the whole country it's probably be very messy. Colin.

JOHN CLEESE:
No I'm afraid you can't, we haven't got time. Just to bring you up to date with a few results, er, that you may have missed. Engelbert Humperdinck has taken Barrow-in-Furness, that's a gain from Ann Haydon-Jones and her husband Pip. Arthur Negus has held Bristols. That's not a result, that's a bit of gossip. Er...Mary Whitehouse has just taken umbrage. Could it be a bit of trouble there. And apparently Wales is not swinging at all. No surprise there. And...Monty Python has held the credits.
