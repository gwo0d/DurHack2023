DIRECTION:
An animated item ends with a sign saying 'And now, the Fish Slapping Dance.'

DIRECTION:
Cut to a quayside. John and Michael, dressed in tropical gear and solar topees. John stannds still while Michael dances up and down before him to the jolly music of Edward German. Michael holds up two tiny fish and from time to time in the course of the dance he slaps John lightly across the cheeks with them. The music ends; Michael stops dancing. John produces a great fish and swipes Michael with it. Michael falls off the quay into the water.
