MICHAEL PALIN:
Meanwhile for Ferdinand von Zeppelin, the year 1908 was a year of triumph.

DIRECTION:

MICHAEL PALIN:
Herr Zeppelin - it's wonderful! It's put ballooning right back on the map.

It's not a

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, it's very nice anyway.

DIRECTION:
to Zeppelin

TERRY JONES:
Tell me, what is the principle of these balloons?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It's not a balloon! You stupid little thick-headed Saxon git! It's not a balloon! Balloons is for kiddy-winkies. If you want to play with balloons, get outside.

Roof splitting noise. A thump and the house shakes. They both look up. Cut back to the airship. The party is still going on.

ERIC IDLE:
I hear you are to name the balloon after Bismarck?

DIRECTION:
flying into hysterical rage

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Bismarck? Of course I'm not calling it after Bismarck. It's a zeppelin. It's nothing to do with bloody Bismarck!

ERIC IDLE:
Surely he gave you some money for it?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Get outside!

DIRECTION:
He opens the door and flings Hollweg out. Cut back to the old couple in the cottage.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Za... bag... lione... a sort of cream mouse... mousse of Italian origin...

DIRECTION:
Roof splintering noise. A thump and the house shakes. Cut back to the airship. A little cluster of people round the door. The party is still going on but there is a little tension in the atmosphere.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ferdinand... that was a Minister of State you just threw out of the balloon.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It's not a balloon! It's an airship!

MICHAEL PALIN:
All right, I'm sorry.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
All right - go and have a look!

DIRECTION:
a very load splintering crash, thump and the house shudders; Mrs Helmut stops knitting and crosses the room to the door and into the next room, where the sounds are coming flora

MICHAEL PALIN:
With tiny pieces of sliced...

DIRECTION:
looking in the other room

TERRY JONES:
Oh, look! It's the Chancellor!

DIRECTION:
Helmut's hand immediately goes to his tie. He half makes to rise.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What? Prince Von Bülow? Here?

TERRY JONES:
Ja!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Coming here?

TERRY JONES:
No - he

DIRECTION:
is

TERRY JONES:
here.

DIRECTION:
jumping to his feet

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, I must go and put my old uniform on.

Dead? Here?

Ja. In our sitting room.

TERRY JONES:
of sitting room.

DIRECTION:
doubtfully

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well...

TERRY JONES:
Look!

DIRECTION:
She opens the door wider to reveal heap of about ten bodies in the other room. There is dust rising from them and a big hole in the ceiling. Helmut goes to the door.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Which one is Von Bülow?

DIRECTION:
They walk round the pile. Mrs Helmut looks at a few bodies and then points.

TERRY JONES:
Here ... look!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, ja ... and Admiral Tirpitz!

DIRECTION:
They are both momentarily overawed.

TERRY JONES:
Ja.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And Von Müller... and Herr Reichner... and Hollweg and Von Graunberg...

TERRY JONES:
That isn't Graunberg -

DIRECTION:
that's

TERRY JONES:
Graunberg... das ist Moltke...

DIRECTION:
She lifts the body's head up by the hair as it's facing down.

MICHAEL PALIN:
He's a lot older than I thought.

TERRY JONES:
He's a clever man, ja.

MICHAEL PALIN:
... and Zimmermann ... and Kimpte...

TERRY JONES:
What shall we do, Helmut?

MICHAEL PALIN:
We must ring the Government.

TERRY JONES:

TERRY JONES:
Ja, well...

MICHAEL PALIN:
There are no members of the Government dead in our sitting room.

TERRY JONES:
Ja, you know what I mean.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Perhaps I should make a little speech or something?

TERRY JONES:
Not a speech, Helmut no...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Shall we make them a cup of tea?

TERRY JONES:
It would be a waste of tea.

MICHAEL PALIN:
But we must do something - so many important people in our drawing room - we must do

DIRECTION:
something

MICHAEL PALIN:
.

DIRECTION:
They think for a little while.

TERRY JONES:
We could sort them out.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And make a little list.

TERRY JONES:
Ja, ja. We could put the ministers for internal affairs over against the wall, and those for foreign here by the clock.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And we can sort them out alphabetically?

TERRY JONES:
Nein, nein - just put the cleanest by the door.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ja.

DIRECTION:
They start to hump the corpses around. Helmut starts to hump Von Bülow towards the clock.

TERRY JONES:
No, no! That's Von Bülow! He must go over here.

MICHAEL PALIN:
That is my reading chair.

TERRY JONES:
He is the Reich Chancellor of Germany, Helmut.

DIRECTION:
Helmut starts to take him towards the reading chair.

MICHAEL PALIN:
All right ... but I think he would have been better up against the clock, you know.

TERRY JONES:
No, he would not look nice under the clock.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I did not say

DIRECTION:
under

DIRECTION:
against

MICHAEL PALIN:
the clock.

TERRY JONES:
Well then we could not see the clock!

MICHAEL PALIN:
We could put the Minister for Colonies under the clock. He's small.

TERRY JONES:
No. Colonies are

DIRECTION:
internal

DIRECTION:
Helmut lifts up the head of another corpse

TERRY JONES:
Education!

DIRECTION:
Helmut starts to drag him over to the wall.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Soon we shall be able to make a list.

TERRY JONES:
Ja, ja, wait a minute! ... Who's that by the cat litter?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I don't know. I've never seen him before.

TERRY JONES:
He is not a member of the Government. Get him out of here. Put him in the drawing room.

MICHAEL PALIN:
He's

DIRECTION:
in

MICHAEL PALIN:
the drawing room, my dear.

TERRY JONES:
Ja, well you know what I mean.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Put him in the sitting room.

TERRY JONES:

You can put him in the sitting room if he's in the drawing room.
