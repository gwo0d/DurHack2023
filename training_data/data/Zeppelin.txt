Ferdinand von Zeppelin was born in Constance in 1838, the brother of Barry Zeppelin, the least talented of the fourteen Zeppelin brothers.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Meanwhile for Ferdinand von Zeppelin, the year 1908 was a year of triumph.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Herr Zeppelin - it's wonderful! It's put ballooning right back on the map.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It's not a

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
... an airship ... d'you hear?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, it's very nice anyway.

TERRY JONES:
Tell me, what is the principle of these balloons?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It's not a balloon! You stupid little thick-headed Saxon git! It's not a balloon! Balloons is for kiddy-winkies. If you want to play with balloons, get outside.

TERRY JONES:
Aaaaaaaaaghhh!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yorkshire ... pudding. A type of thick pancake, eaten with large ...

ERIC IDLE:
I hear you are to name the balloon after Bismarck?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Bismarck? Of course I'm not calling it after Bismarck. It's a zeppelin. It's nothing to do with bloody Bismarck!

ERIC IDLE:
Surely he gave you some money for it?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Get outside!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Za... bag... lione... a sort of cream mouse... mousse of Italian origin...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ferdinand... that was a Minister of State you just threw out of the balloon.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It's not a balloon! It's an airship!

MICHAEL PALIN:
All right, I'm sorry.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
All right - go and have a look!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
And you!

What? Prince Von B端low? Here?

TERRY JONES:
Ja!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Coming here?

TERRY JONES:
No - he

TERRY JONES:

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, I must go and put my old uniform on.

TERRY JONES:
He won't notice, Helmut. He's dead.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Dead? Here?

TERRY JONES:
Ja. In our sitting room.

MICHAEL PALIN:
This is our sitting room, dear.

TERRY JONES:
Well, you know what I mean.

MICHAEL PALIN:
room!

TERRY JONES:
Yes ... but it's a

TERRY JONES:
of sitting room.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well...

TERRY JONES:
Look!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Which one is Von B端low?

TERRY JONES:
Here ... look!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, ja ... and Admiral Tirpitz!

TERRY JONES:
Ja.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And Von M端ller... and Herr Reichner... and Hollweg and Von Graunberg...

TERRY JONES:
That isn't Graunberg -

TERRY JONES:
Graunberg... das ist Moltke...

MICHAEL PALIN:
He's a lot older than I thought.

TERRY JONES:
He's a clever man, ja.

MICHAEL PALIN:
... and Zimmermann ... and Kimpte...

TERRY JONES:
What shall we do, Helmut?

MICHAEL PALIN:
We must ring the Government.

TERRY JONES:
This

TERRY JONES:
the Government, Helmut.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh dear.

TERRY JONES:
It is a great honour to have so many members of the Government dead in our sitting room.

MICHAEL PALIN:
room.

TERRY JONES:
Ja, well...

MICHAEL PALIN:
There are no members of the Government dead in our sitting room.

TERRY JONES:
Ja, you know what I mean.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Perhaps I should make a little speech or something?

TERRY JONES:
Not a speech, Helmut no...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Shall we make them a cup of tea?

TERRY JONES:
It would be a waste of tea.

MICHAEL PALIN:
But we must do something - so many important people in our drawing room - we must do

MICHAEL PALIN:
.

TERRY JONES:
We could sort them out.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And make a little list.

TERRY JONES:
Ja, ja. We could put the ministers for internal affairs over against the wall, and those for foreign here by the clock.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And we can sort them out alphabetically?

TERRY JONES:
Nein, nein - just put the cleanest by the door.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ja.

TERRY JONES:
No, no! That's Von B端low! He must go over here.

MICHAEL PALIN:
That is my reading chair.

TERRY JONES:
He is the Reich Chancellor of Germany, Helmut.

MICHAEL PALIN:
All right ... but I think he would have been better up against the clock, you know.

TERRY JONES:
No, he would not look nice under the clock.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I did not say

MICHAEL PALIN:
the clock.

TERRY JONES:
Well then we could not see the clock!

MICHAEL PALIN:
We could put the Minister for Colonies under the clock. He's small.

TERRY JONES:
No. Colonies are

TERRY JONES:
Education!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Soon we shall be able to make a list.

TERRY JONES:
Ja, ja, wait a minute! ... Who's that by the cat litter?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I don't know. I've never seen him before.

TERRY JONES:
He is not a member of the Government. Get him out of here. Put him in the drawing room.

MICHAEL PALIN:
He's

MICHAEL PALIN:
the drawing room, my dear.

TERRY JONES:
Ja, well you know what I mean.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Put him in the sitting room.

TERRY JONES:
Ja, in, the sittng room, it's all the same.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You can put him in the sitting room if he's in the drawing room.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Count Ferdinand Von Zeppelin's behaviour on that flight in 1900 had incredible, far-reaching consequences, for one of the falling Ministers
