JOHN CLEESE:
Attila the Hun to see you, sir.

TERRY JONES:
Who?

JOHN CLEESE:
Attila the Hun, sir.

TERRY JONES:
Oh botherkins! Er, constable, go and see to him will you?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What! In this dress?

TERRY JONES:
Oh all right, I'll go.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, I have got a little green pinny I could wear...

TERRY JONES:
No, no, no, I'll go. You stay here.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh goody! I can get on with the ironing.

TERRY JONES:
Right where is he?

JOHN CLEESE:
Over there, sir.

TERRY JONES:
Right, er, all right sergeant leave this to me. Er, now then sir, you are Attila the Hun.

MICHAEL PALIN:
That's right, yes. A. T. Hun. My parents were Mr and Mrs Norman Hun, but they had a little joke when I was born.

TERRY JONES:
Yes well, Mr Hun ...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh! Call me 'The', for heaven's sake!

TERRY JONES:
Oh well, The... what do you want to see us about?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I've come to give myself up.

TERRY JONES:
What for?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Looting, pillaging and sacking a major city.

TERRY JONES:
I beg your pardon?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Looting, pillaging, sacking a major city, and I'd like nine thousand other charges to be taken into consideration, please.

TERRY JONES:
I say, excuse me, Mr Hun.

TERRY JONES:
Have you any objection to taking a breath test?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

TERRY JONES:
Right, er, sergeant will you bring the Hunalyser, please?

JOHN CLEESE:
Here we are, sir.

TERRY JONES:
Er, how's it work?

JOHN CLEESE:
Well he breathes into it, sir, and the white crystals turn lime green. Then he is Attila the Hun, sir.

TERRY JONES:
I see. Right. Would you mind breathing into this Mr Hun?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right.

TERRY JONES:
What if nothing happens, sergeant?

JOHN CLEESE:
He's Alexander the Great!

TERRY JONES:
Ha, ha! Caught you, Mr A. T. Great!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh curses! Curses! I thought I was safe, disguised as Attila the Hun.

TERRY JONES:
Oh perhaps so, but you made one fatal mistake... you see, this wasn't a Hunalyser... it was an Alexander the Greatalyser Take him away, Beryl!

ERIC IDLE:
Dear Sir, I object very strongly to that last scene, and to the next letter.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Dear Sir, I object to being objected to by the last letter, before my drift has become apparent. I spent many years in India during the last war and am now a part-time notice board in a prominent public school. Yours etc., Brigadier Zoe La Rue (deceased). PS Aghhh!

JOHN CLEESE:
Dear Sir, When I was at school, I was beaten regularly every thirty minutes, and it never did me any harm - except for psychological maladjusunent and blurred vision. Yours truly, Flight Lieutenant Ken Frankenstein (Mrs).
