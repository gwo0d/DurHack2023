TERRY JONES:
You're a loony.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I get so bored. I get so bloody bored.

DIRECTION:
ANIMATION:

DIRECTION:
for a minute or two strange things happen on animation until suddenly we find ourselves into the animated title sequence.

DIRECTION:
Cut to the announcer in a silly location, sitting at his desk as usual.

JOHN CLEESE:
You probably noticed that I didn't say 'and now for something completely different' just now. This is simply because I am unable to appear in the show this week.

DIRECTION:
looks closely at script, puzzled

JOHN CLEESE:
Sorry to interrupt you.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a man holding his mouth open to show the camera his teeth.

TERRY JONES:
I'm terribly sorry to interrupt but my tooth's hurting, just around here.

DIRECTION:
Get off.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, sorry.

DIRECTION:
Cut to pompous moustached stockbroker type.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'm not sorry to interrupt - I'll interrupt anything if it gets people looking in my direction - like at my old school where, by a coincidence, the annual prize giving is going on at this very moment.
