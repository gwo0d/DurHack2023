TERRY JONES:
Fivepenny please.

TERRY JONES:
Morning.

TERRY JONES:
Not so warm today, George.

TERRY JONES:
Good morning.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Come in, Mr Horton.

TERRY JONES:
Morning, sir.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Do - do sit down.

TERRY JONES:
Thank you, sir.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Now then Horton, you've been with us for twenty years, and your work in the accounts department has been immaculate

MICHAEL PALIN:
... has undermined the competence of this firm to such a point that I'm afraid that I've got no option but to sack you.

TERRY JONES:
It couldn't have come at a worse time. There's school fees for the two boys coming up, and the wife's treatment costing more now ... I don't know where the money's coming from as it is. And now I don't see any future ... I'd been hoping I'd be able to hang on here just for the last couple of years but... now ... I just want to go out and end it all.
