DIRECTION:
An animated sequence then leads us to a gents suburban hairdressing salon. A customer comes in. The barber is standing in a white coat washing his hands at a basin.

TERRY JONES:
Morning.

DIRECTION:
flinching slightly

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah ... good morning sir, good morning. I'll be with you in a minute.

DIRECTION:
Customer sits in barber's chair. Barber carries on washing. He seems to be over-thoroughly washing and rewashing his hands and lower arms. Barber turns and smiles humourlessly, at customer. At last he has finished washing. He dries his hands thoroughly, turns and comes over to the customer. There are very obvious blood stains on his coat and his lapel is torn off. One stain could be the mark of a bloodstained hand which has slipped down the length of it. He picks up a sheet and shakes it out. Sound of iron and heavy objects falling on the floor. He throws it around the customer. As he knots the sheet at the back he is about to pull it tight and strangle the customer. His face sweats, a wild look in his eyes. Then with a supreme effort he controls himself. Customer smiles reassuringly at him.

MICHAEL PALIN:
How... how would you like it, sir?

TERRY JONES:
Just short back and sides please.

MICHAEL PALIN:
How do you do that?

TERRY JONES:
Well it's just... ordinary short back and sides.

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's not a ... razor cut?

DIRECTION:
suddenly

DIRECTION:
controlling himself

DIRECTION:
sigh of relief

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's just a scissors.

TERRY JONES:
Yes...

DIRECTION:
laughs, thinking the barber must be having a little joke

MICHAEL PALIN:
You wouldn't rather just have it combed, would you sir?

TERRY JONES:
I beg your pardon?

MICHAEL PALIN:
You wouldn't rather forget all about it?

TERRY JONES:
No, no, no, I want it cut.

DIRECTION:
At the word cut barber winces.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Cut, cut, cut, blood, spurt, artery, murder, Hitchcock, Psycho... right sir ... well ...

DIRECTION:
swallows hard

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'll just get everything ready. In the meanwhile perhaps you could fill in one of these.

DIRECTION:
He hands him a bit of paper; the barber goes to a cupboard and opens it.

TERRY JONES:
All right, fine, yes.

DIRECTION:
On the inside of the door there is a large medical chart headed: 'Main Arteries'. His shaking hand traces the arteries and he looks occasionally back at the customer.

TERRY JONES:
Excuse me, er...

MICHAEL PALIN:
What?

TERRY JONES:
Where it says: 'next of kin' shall I put 'mother'?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, yes ... yes.

TERRY JONES:
Right there we are.

DIRECTION:
hands form to barber

MICHAEL PALIN:
Thank you.

DIRECTION:
He gets scissors and comb ready and comes up behind the customer and spreads his arms out, opening and shutting scissors as barbers do before cutting.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right!

DIRECTION:
He can't bring himself to start cutting; after one or two attempts he goes to the cupboard again, gets a whisky bottle out and takes a hard swig. He comes up behind the customer again.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ha, ha, ha ... there, I've finished.

TERRY JONES:
What?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I've finished cutting... cutting... cutting your hair. It's all done,

TERRY JONES:
You haven't started cutting it!

MICHAEL PALIN:
I have! I did it very quickly... your honour...

DIRECTION:
sir

MICHAEL PALIN:
... sir...

DIRECTION:
getting rather testy

TERRY JONES:
Look here old fellow, I know when a chap's cut my hair and when he hasn't. So will you please stop fooling around and get on with it.

DIRECTION:
The barber bends down to the floor and drags out a tape recorder which he places behind the barber's chair, talking as he does so.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, yes, I will, I'm going to cut your hair, sir. I'm going to start cutting your hair, sir, start cutting now!

DIRECTION:
He switches on tape recorder and then he himself cowers down against the wall as far from the chair as he can get, trembling.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Nice day, sir,

TERRY JONES:
Yes, flowers could do with a drop of rain though, eh?

DIRECTION:
snip, snip

MICHAEL PALIN:
Did you see the match last night, sir?

TERRY JONES:
Yes. Good game. I thought.

DIRECTION:
snip, snip, snip; sound of electric razor starting up

MICHAEL PALIN:
I thought Hurst played well sir.

DIRECTION:
straining to hear

DIRECTION:
razor stops

MICHAEL PALIN:
I thought Hurst played well.

TERRY JONES:
Oh yes ... yes ... he was the only one who did though.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Can you put your head down a little, sir?

TERRY JONES:
Sorry, sorry.

DIRECTION:
his head is bowed

MICHAEL PALIN:
I prefer to watch Palace nowadays.

DIRECTION:
electric razor starts up again

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh! Sorry! Was that your ear?

TERRY JONES:
No no ... I didn't feel a thing.

DIRECTION:
The customer rises out from his seat, taking the sheet off himself and looking in the mirror and delving into pocket. He turns round for the first time and sees the cowering barber.

TERRY JONES:
Look, what's going on?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, it's a nice spot, isn't it.

TERRY JONES:
Look, I came here for a haircut!

DIRECTION:
pathetically

MICHAEL PALIN:
It looks very nice sir.

DIRECTION:
angrily

TERRY JONES:
It's exactly the same as when I first came in.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right, that's the lot then.
