TERRY JONES:
Morning.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah ... good morning sir, good morning. I'll be with you in a minute.

MICHAEL PALIN:
How... how would you like it, sir?

TERRY JONES:
Just short back and sides please.

MICHAEL PALIN:
How do you do that?

TERRY JONES:
Well it's just... ordinary short back and sides.

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's not a ... razor cut?

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's just a scissors.

TERRY JONES:
Yes...

MICHAEL PALIN:
You wouldn't rather just have it combed, would you sir?

TERRY JONES:
I beg your pardon?

MICHAEL PALIN:
You wouldn't rather forget all about it?

TERRY JONES:
No, no, no, I want it cut.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Cut, cut, cut, blood, spurt, artery, murder, Hitchcock, Psycho... right sir ... well ...

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'll just get everything ready. In the meanwhile perhaps you could fill in one of these.

TERRY JONES:
All right, fine, yes.

TERRY JONES:
Excuse me, er...

MICHAEL PALIN:
What?

TERRY JONES:
Where it says: 'next of kin' shall I put 'mother'?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, yes ... yes.

TERRY JONES:
Right there we are.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Thank you.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ha, ha, ha ... there, I've finished.

TERRY JONES:
What?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I've finished cutting... cutting... cutting your hair. It's all done,

TERRY JONES:
You haven't started cutting it!

MICHAEL PALIN:
I have! I did it very quickly... your honour...

MICHAEL PALIN:
... sir...

TERRY JONES:
Look here old fellow, I know when a chap's cut my hair and when he hasn't. So will you please stop fooling around and get on with it.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, yes, I will, I'm going to cut your hair, sir. I'm going to start cutting your hair, sir, start cutting now!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Nice day, sir,

TERRY JONES:
Yes, flowers could do with a drop of rain though, eh?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Did you see the match last night, sir?

TERRY JONES:
Yes. Good game. I thought.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I thought Hurst played well sir.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I thought Hurst played well.

TERRY JONES:
Oh yes ... yes ... he was the only one who did though.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Can you put your head down a little, sir?

TERRY JONES:
Sorry, sorry.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I prefer to watch Palace nowadays.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh! Sorry! Was that your ear?

TERRY JONES:
No no ... I didn't feel a thing.

TERRY JONES:
Look, what's going on?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, it's a nice spot, isn't it.

TERRY JONES:
Look, I came here for a haircut!

MICHAEL PALIN:
It looks very nice sir.

TERRY JONES:
It's exactly the same as when I first came in.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right, that's the lot then.
