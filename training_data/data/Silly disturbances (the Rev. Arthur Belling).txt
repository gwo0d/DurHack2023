Excuse me, do you mind if I join you?

JOHN CLEESE:
Er, no... no... no... not at all.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Are you

MICHAEL PALIN:
you don't mind?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, yes, absolutely.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You're sure I won't be disturbing you?

JOHN CLEESE:
No, no.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You're absolutely sure I won't be disturbing you?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
No, no really.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good. Because I don't want to disturb you. Specially as you're being so kind about me not disturbing you.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, no, no, we don't mind, do we, darling?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh no, darling.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good, so I can go ahead and join you then? Can I?

Won't be disturbing?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good, good. You're very kind.

JOHN CLEESE:
We must be getting on.

I knew I'd disturb you ... I knew I'd disturb you ...

MICHAEL PALIN:
It always happens ... whenever I've found someone I really think I'm going to be able to get on with...

JOHN CLEESE:
No, the only thing is, you see, we're going to be a little bit late.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Let's stay.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, just a little bit... I mean, we will be late if we don't...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, thank you. You're very kind.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
we'd hurry along to St Loony up the Cream Bun and Jam.

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's...
