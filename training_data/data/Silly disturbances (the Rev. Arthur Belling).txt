CAROL CLEVELAND:
It's nice here, darling, isn't it.

JOHN CLEESE:
It's beautiful, it's Paris all over again.

DIRECTION:
Enter a vicar, dressed normally but has bald wig with fright hair at sides. He carries a suitcase.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Excuse me, do you mind if I join you?

JOHN CLEESE:
Er, no... no... no... not at all.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Are you

DIRECTION:
sure

MICHAEL PALIN:
you don't mind?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, yes, absolutely.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You're sure I won't be disturbing you?

JOHN CLEESE:
No, no.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You're absolutely sure I won't be disturbing you?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
No, no really.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good. Because I don't want to disturb you. Specially as you're being so kind about me not disturbing you.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, no, no, we don't mind, do we, darling?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh no, darling.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good, so I can go ahead and join you then? Can I?

DIRECTION:
Yes ... yes...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Won't be disturbing?

DIRECTION:
No. No.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good, good. You're very kind.

DIRECTION:
he sits down

DIRECTION:
he makes strange gestures with his hands

MICHAEL PALIN:
Let alone when I specifically tell them about my being disturbing.

JOHN CLEESE:
... Well, it's not

DIRECTION:
particularly

JOHN CLEESE:
disturbing.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, absolutely, absolutely, that's what I always say.

DIRECTION:
he produces plates from his case and smashes them on the table

DIRECTION:
he produces a rubber crab suspended from a ping-pong paddle and a rubber baby doll and bobs them up and down, making loud silly noises as he does so

DIRECTION:
he breaks more plates and squirts shaving cream over his head; he and she get up to leave

JOHN CLEESE:
We must be getting on.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I knew I'd disturb you ... I knew I'd disturb you ...

DIRECTION:
miserably

MICHAEL PALIN:
It always happens ... whenever I've found someone I really think I'm going to be able to get on with...

JOHN CLEESE:
No, the only thing is, you see, we're going to be a little bit late.

DIRECTION:
sitting down and comforting vicar

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Let's stay.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, just a little bit... I mean, we will be late if we don't...

DIRECTION:
he sits down reluctantly

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, thank you. You're very kind.

DIRECTION:
More silly behaviour from the vicar. He and she look embarrassed. Dissolve to them sitting at home smashing plates, making silly noises and covering themselves with shaving cream.

film of them running into a church

CAROL CLEVELAND:
we'd hurry along to St Loony up the Cream Bun and Jam.

JOHN CLEESE:
And now...

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's...
