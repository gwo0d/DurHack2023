ERIC IDLE:
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Refreshment Room here at Bletchley.

ERIC IDLE:
Someone whose boots I would gladly lick clean until holes wore through my tongue, a man who is so totally and utterly wonderful, that I would rather be sealed in a pit of my own filth, than dare tread on the same stage with him.Ladies and gentlemen, the incomparably superior human being, Harry Fink!

ERIC IDLE:
Never mind, it's not all it's cracked up to be. Ladies and gentlemen, we give you Ken Buddha and his inflatable knees.

ERIC IDLE:
Ken Buddha, a smile, two bangs and a religion. Now ladies and gentlemen, for your further entertainment, Brian Islam and Brucie.

MICHAEL PALIN:
So anyway, I became a barber.

TERRY JONES:
Poor chap.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, pity really, I always preferred the outdoor life. Hunting, shooting, fishing. Getting out there with a gun, slaughtering a few of God's creatures - that was the life. Charging about the moorland, blasting their heads off.
