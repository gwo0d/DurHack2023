DIRECTION:
A cartoon advertising 'Interesting Lives' leads to film of milkman (Michael) delivering milk to a suburban house. As he puts the milk down, the front door opens and a seductively dressed young lady (Carol) beckons him inside. Glancing round furtively he follows her into the house and up the stairs. She leads him to the bedroom door, opens it, and ushers him inside, closing the door behind him. Inside, he is bewildered to see several elderly milkmen, who have obviously been there for a very long time.
