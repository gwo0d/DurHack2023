JOHN CLEESE:
A blancmange, eh?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, that's right. I was just having a game of doubles with Sandra and Jocasta, Alec and David...

JOHN CLEESE:
Hang on!

ERIC IDLE:
What?

JOHN CLEESE:
There's five.

JOHN CLEESE:
Five people . . . how do you play doubles with five people?

ERIC IDLE:
Ah, well ... we were...

JOHN CLEESE:
Sounds a bit funny if you ask me ... playing doubles with five people...

ERIC IDLE:
Well we often play like that... Jocasta plays on the side receiving service...

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh yes?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes. It helps to speed the game up and make it a lot faster, and it means Jocasta isn't left out.

JOHN CLEESE:
Look, are you asking me to believe that the five of you was playing doubles, when on the very next court there was a blancmange playing by itself?.

ERIC IDLE:
That's right, yes.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well answer me this then - why didn't Jocasta play the blancmange at singles, while you and Sandra and Alec and David had a proper game of doubles with four people?

ERIC IDLE:
Because Jocasta always plays with us. She's a friend of ours.

JOHN CLEESE:
Call that friendship? Messing up a perfectly good game of doubles?

ERIC IDLE:
It's not messing it up, officer, we like to play with five.

JOHN CLEESE:
Look it's

JOHN CLEESE:
affair if you want to play with five people ... but don't go calling it doubles. Look at Wimbledon, right? If Fred Stolle and Tony Roche played Charlie Pasarell and Cliff Drysdale and Peaches Bartcowitz... they wouldn't go calling it doubles.

ERIC IDLE:
But what about the blancmange?

JOHN CLEESE:
That could play Ann Haydon-Jones and her husband Pip.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, a blancmange gave you an order for 48,000,000 kilts?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Aye!

TERRY JONES:
And you

TERRY JONES:
it?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Aye, I did.

TERRY JONES:
Och, you're a stupid man, Angus Podgorny.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I believe it.

TERRY JONES:
Even if it's from a blancmange?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Och, woman, if a blancmange is prepared to come 2,200,000 light years to purchase a kilt, they must be fairly keen on kilts. So cease yer prattling woman and get sewing. This could be the biggest breakthrough in kilts since the Provost of Edinburgh sat on a spike. Mary, we'll be rich! We'll be rich!

TERRY JONES:
Oh, but Angus... he hasna given you an earnest of his good faith!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah mebbe not but he has gi' me this...

TERRY JONES:
What is it now?

MICHAEL PALIN:
An entry form for the British Open Tennis Championships at Wimbledon Toon ... signed and seconded.

TERRY JONES:
Och, but Angus, ye ken full well that Scots folk dinna know how to play the tennis to save their lives.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Aye, but I must go though dear, I dinna want to seem ungrateful.

TERRY JONES:
Ach! Angus, I wilna let you make a fool o'yourself.

MICHAEL PALIN:
But I must.

TERRY JONES:
Och, no you'll not ...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, Mary...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, oh, Mary! Look out! Look out!

TERRY JONES:
Urrgh. It's the blancmange.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, now this is where Mr Podgorny could have saved his wife's life. If he'd gone to the police and told them that he'd been approached by unearthly beings from the Galaxy of Andromeda, we'd have sent a man round to investigate. As it was he did a deal with a blancmange, and the blancmange ate his wife. So if you're going out, or going on holiday, or anything strange happens involving other galaxies, just nip round to your local police station, and tell the sergeant on duty - or his wife - of your suspicions. And the same goes for dogs. So I'm sorry to have interrupted your exciting science fiction story ... but, then, crime's our business you know. So carry on viewing, and my thanks to the BBC for allowing me to have this little chat with you. Goodnight. God bless, look after yourselves.

ERIC IDLE:
Do sit down, Mr Podgorny... I... I ... think what's happened is ... terribly ... terribly... funny .... tragic. But you must understand that we have to catch the creature that ate your wife, and if you could help us answer a few questions, we may be able to help save a few lives. I know this is the way your wife would have wanted it.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Aye ... I'll ... do ... my best, sergeant.

ERIC IDLE:
Detective Inspector!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Er, detective inspector.

ERIC IDLE:
Now then. The facts are these. You received an order for 48,000,000 kilts from a blancmange from the planet Skyron in the Galaxy of Andromeda ... you'd just shown your wife an entry form for Wimbledon, which you'd filled in... when you turned round and saw her legs disappearing into a blancmange. Is that correct?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
Are you mad?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
Well that's a relief. 'Cos if you were, your story would be less plausible.

ERIC IDLE:
Now then, do you recognize this?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh yes. That's the one that ate my Mary!

ERIC IDLE:
Good. His name's Riley... Jack Riley... He's that most rare of criminals ... a blancmange impersonator and cannibal.

MICHAEL PALIN:
But what about the 48,000,000 kilts and the Galaxy of Andromeda?

ERIC IDLE:
I'm afraid that's just one of his stories. You must understand that a blancmange impersonator and cannibal has to use some pretty clever stories to allay suspicion.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Then you mean...

ERIC IDLE:
Yes.

MICHAEL PALIN:
But...

ERIC IDLE:
How?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes.

ERIC IDLE:
Well...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Not?

ERIC IDLE:
I'm afraid so.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Why?

ERIC IDLE:
Who knows?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Do you think?

ERIC IDLE:
Could be.

ERIC IDLE:
I know.

MICHAEL PALIN:
She was...

ERIC IDLE:
Good lord what's that?

ERIC IDLE:
Eh Riley? Riley! Riley! It's not Riley!

ERIC IDLE:
It's an extra-terrestial being! Agggh!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
So, everyone in England is being turned into Scotsmen, right?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Now, which is the worst tennis-playing nation in the world?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No. Try again.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No... try again but say a different place.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, course you didn't say it badly. Now hurry.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No! Scotland!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Now ... now these blancmanges, apart from the one that killed Mrs Podgorny have all appeared in which London suburb?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No. Wimbledon ... Now do you begin to see the pattern? With what sport is Wimbledon commonly associated?

TERRY JONES:
For viewers at home, the answer is coming up on your screens. Those of you who wish to play it the hard way, stand upside down with your head in a bucket of piranha fish. Here is the question once again.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
With what sport is Wimbledon commonly associated?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No. Wimbledon is most commonly associated with tennis.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, it all falls into place!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No ... not quite ... but, er, just look in here.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes. So these blancmanges, blancmange-shaped creatures come from the planet Skyron in the Galaxy of Andromeda. They order 48,000,000 kilts from a Scottish menswear shop ... turn the population of England into Scotsmen (well known as the worst tennis-playing nation on Earth) thus leaving England empty

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
. This can only mean one thing!

TERRY JONES:
'THEY MEAN TO WIN WIMBLEDON'

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
They mean to

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
