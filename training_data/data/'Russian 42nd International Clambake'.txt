JOHN CLEESE:
Beluntanks dretsky mihai ovna isky Mr Reg Pither.

JOHN CLEESE:

JOHN CLEESE:
And now, Comrades, the greatest moment of the day, the moment when I ask you to welcome the return of one of Russia's greatest heroes, creator of the Red Army, Lenin's greatest friend, Lev Davidovich Trotsky!

TERRY JONES:
Comrades. Bolsheviks. Friends of the Revolution. I have returned.

TERRY JONES:
I want an old-fashioned house with an old-fashioned fence, and an old-fashioned millionaire.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Our friend Mr Gulliver was clearly undergoing another change of personality.

JOHN CLEESE:
So! You have duped us. You shall pay for this. Guards, seize him.

JOHN CLEESE:
Shall I seize him too?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, I think we'll have to keep him, he's going down well.

JOHN CLEESE:
He's more fun than he used to be.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
He's loosened up a lot. This is an old Lenin number.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What a pleasant exercise yard. How friendly they were all being.

JOHN CLEESE:
Cigarettes?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, no thank you I don't smoke.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I looked around but could not see the target.

JOHN CLEESE:
Blindfold?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No thank you, no.

JOHN CLEESE:
Verschnitzen.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Nyet! Nyet! Nyet!

JOHN CLEESE:
A telegram?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Now I was really for it.

JOHN CLEESE:
How could you miss?

ERIC IDLE:
He moved.

JOHN CLEESE:
Shut up! Go and practise.

JOHN CLEESE:
I'm so sorry. Do you mind waiting in your cell?

MICHAEL PALIN:
What a stroke of luck. My Crunchie was totally intact. I settled down to a quick intermeal snack...

JOHN CLEESE:
Next time. Definitely!

JOHN CLEESE:
Now then, how many of them have been injured? Oh God...

MICHAEL PALIN:
As I lay dwon to the sound of the Russian gentlemen practising their shooting, I realised I was in a bit of a pickle. My heart sank as I realised I should never see the Okehampton by-pass again...

ERIC IDLE:
Come on, dear. Wake up dear.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Mother!

ERIC IDLE:
Come on dear.

MICHAEL PALIN:
So, it was all a dream.

ERIC IDLE:
No dear,

ERIC IDLE:
is the dream, you're still in the cell.

JOHN CLEESE:
OK, we're going to have another try. I think we've got it now. My boys have been looking down the wrong bit, you see.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh no, look, you've got to look down the bit there.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh I thought you had to look down that bit.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, no, you've got to look down that bit, or you won't hit anything.

JOHN CLEESE:
Alright, we'll give it a whirl. Guards, seize him.

JOHN CLEESE:
Listen. You've got to look down this bit.

ERIC IDLE:
Osledi Osledi.

ERIC IDLE:
Eartha Kitt!

TERRY JONES:
That turnip's certainly not safe.

TERRY JONES:
Oh no! Mr Pither! Mr Pither!

TERRY JONES:
Mr Pither! Mr Pither!

TERRY JONES:
Mr Pither!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Here!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Gulliver.

TERRY JONES:
Pither! What a stroke of luck.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well yes and no.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Phew, what an amazing escape. Well goodbye, Reginald.

TERRY JONES:
Goodbye, Mr Pither, and good luck with the tour!
