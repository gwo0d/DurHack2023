ERIC IDLE:
This is an example of the sort of abuse we get all the time from ignorant people. I inherited this religion from my father, an ex-used-car salesman and part-time window-box, and I am very proud to be in charge of the first religion with free gifts. You get this luxury tea-trolley with every new enrollment.

ERIC IDLE:
In addition to this you can win a three-piece lounge suite, this luxury caravan, a weekend for two with Peter Bonetti and tonights star prize, the entire Norwich City Council.

ERIC IDLE:
And remember with only eight scoring draws you can win a bishopric in a see of your own choice. You see we have a much more modern approach to religion.

ERIC IDLE:
Blessed is Arthur Crackpot and all his subsidiaries Ltd. You see, in our Church we have a lot more fun.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, Mrs Collins, you did say you were nervous, didn't you? You have eyes on the coffee machine?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I don't mind, I don't mind - it's just nice to be here, Reverend.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, Mrs Collins, you had eyes on the coffee machine. Well you have won tonight's star prize: the entire Norwich City Council.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I've got one already.

ERIC IDLE:
A lot of religions - no names no pack drill - do go for the poorer type of person - face it, there's more of 'em - poor people, thieves, villains, poor people without no money at all - well we don't have none of that. Rich people and crumpet over sixteen can enter free: upper middle class quite welcome; lower middle class not under five grand a year. Lower class - I can't touch it. There's no return on it, you see.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Do you have any difficulty converting people?

ERIC IDLE:
Oh no, well we have ways of making them join.

ERIC IDLE:
Norman there does a lot of converting: a lot of protection, that sort of thing. And there's his mate, Bruce Beer.

ERIC IDLE:
Brucie has personally converted ninety-two people twenty-five inside the distance. Then again we're not afraid to use more modern methods.

JOHN CLEESE:
Sarah, today's diocesan lovely is enough to make any chap go down on his knees. This twenty-three-year-old bishop hails appropriately enough from Bishop's Stortford and lists her hobbies as swimming, riding, and film producers. What a gas! Bet she's no novice when it comes to converting all in her See.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'm starting a war for peace.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Cor blimey. I'm raising polecats for peace.

ERIC IDLE:
Peace? I like a peace. Know what I mean? Know what I mean? Say no more. Nudge, nudge.

JOHN CLEESE:
Our religion is the first Church to cater for the naughty type of person. If you'd like a bit of 'love-your-neighbour' - and who doesn't now and again - then see Vera and Ciceley during the hymns.

MICHAEL PALIN:
In our Church we try to help people to help themselves - to cars, washing machines, lead piping, no questions asked. We are the only Church, apart from the Baptists, to do respray jobs.

TERRY JONES:
We at the Church of the Divine Loony believe in the power of prayer to turn the head purple ha, ha, ha.

JOHN CLEESE:
I would like to come in here for a moment if I may, and disassociate our Church from these frivolous and offensive religions. We are primarily concerned with what is best...

JOHN CLEESE:
... for the human soul.

JOHN CLEESE:
In this picture there are forty people. None of them can be seen. In this film we hope to show how not to be seen.

JOHN CLEESE:
This is Mr E. R. Bradshaw, of Napier Court, Black Lion Road, SE5. He cannot be seen. Now I'm going to ask him to stand up. Mr Bradshaw will you stand up please?

JOHN CLEESE:
This demonstrates the value of not being seen.

JOHN CLEESE:
In this picture we canot see Mrs. B.J. Smegma of 13, The Cresent, Belmont. Mrs Smegma will you stand up please.

JOHN CLEESE:
This is Mr Nesbitt of Harlow New Town. Mr Nesbit would you stand up please.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes it was the middle one.

JOHN CLEESE:
Mr Ken Andrews, of Leighton Road, Slough, has concealed himself extremely well. He could be almost anywhere. He could be behind the wall, inside the water barrel, beneath a pile of leaves, up in the tree, squatting down behind the car, concealed in a hollow, or crouched behind any one of a hundred bushes. However we happen to know he's in the water barrel.

JOHN CLEESE:
Mr. and Mrs. Watson of 'Ivy Cottage', Worplesdon Road, Hull, chose a very cunning way of not being seen. When we called at their house, we found that they had gone away on two weeks holiday. They had not left any forwading address, and they had bolted and barred the house to prevent us getting in. However a neighbour told us where there were.

JOHN CLEESE:
And here is the neighbour who told us where they were
