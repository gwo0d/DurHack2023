ERIC IDLE:
This is an example of the sort of abuse we get all the time from ignorant people. I inherited this religion from my father, an ex-used-car salesman and part-time window-box, and I am very proud to be in charge of the first religion with free gifts. You get this luxury tea-trolley with every new enrollment.

DIRECTION:
pictures of this and the subsequent gifts

ERIC IDLE:
In addition to this you can win a three-piece lounge suite, this luxury caravan, a weekend for two with Peter Bonetti and tonights star prize, the entire Norwich City Council.

DIRECTION:
Curtains go up to reveal the council. Terrific 'ooh' from an audience. Bad organ chords played by a nude man

DIRECTION:
.

ERIC IDLE:
And remember with only eight scoring draws you can win a bishopric in a see of your own choice. You see we have a much more modern approach to religion.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a person in church. They are walking past a pillar. They take out some money and put it in a collecting box. A sign on the box says 'For the rich'. We hear the money going in, then it moves off, along pipes, falling down; eventually it comes down a small pipe and lands with a tinkle in Crackpot's ashtray. He tries the money with his teeth, pops it into his pocket, and finishes reading...

ERIC IDLE:
Blessed is Arthur Crackpot and all his subsidiaries Ltd. You see, in our Church we have a lot more fun.

DIRECTION:
we see he has a pepperpot with him

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, Mrs Collins, you did say you were nervous, didn't you? You have eyes on the coffee machine?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I don't mind, I don't mind - it's just nice to be here, Reverend.

DIRECTION:
slaps her

DIRECTION:
goes to hymn board, removes one of the numbers, and reads what's on the back

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, Mrs Collins, you had eyes on the coffee machine. Well you have won tonight's star prize: the entire Norwich City Council.

DIRECTION:
Organ music, oohs and applause from audience.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I've got one already.

DIRECTION:
the priest starts to throttle her

DIRECTION:
Cut back to Crackpot in his Office.

ERIC IDLE:
A lot of religions - no names no pack drill - do go for the poorer type of person - face it, there's more of 'em - poor people, thieves, villains, poor people without no money at all - well we don't have none of that. Rich people and crumpet over sixteen can enter free: upper middle class quite welcome; lower middle class not under five grand a year. Lower class - I can't touch it. There's no return on it, you see.

DIRECTION:
Pull back to show interviewer sitting at his side.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Do you have any difficulty converting people?

ERIC IDLE:
Oh no, well we have ways of making them join.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a photo of a bishops

DIRECTION:
SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'THE ARCHBISHOP OF AUSTRALIA'

ERIC IDLE:
Brucie has personally converted ninety-two people twenty-five inside the distance. Then again we're not afraid to use more modern methods.

DIRECTION:
Cut to 'Daily Mirror' type pin-up of a bikinied lovely in a silly pose, on a beach with a bishop's mitre and Bible. A large headline reads 'North See Gas'. A subheading says 'Bishop Sarah', then below that, this blurb which is also read voice over.

JOHN CLEESE:
Sarah, today's diocesan lovely is enough to make any chap go down on his knees. This twenty-three-year-old bishop hails appropriately enough from Bishop's Stortford and lists her hobbies as swimming, riding, and film producers. What a gas! Bet she's no novice when it comes to converting all in her See.

DIRECTION:
Cut to Gumby in street.

DIRECTION:
SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'ARCHBISHOP GUMBY'

DIRECTION:
SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'ARCHBISHOP NUDGE'

ERIC IDLE:
Peace? I like a peace. Know what I mean? Know what I mean? Say no more. Nudge, nudge.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a bishop. A sign on the wall says 'Naughty Religion '.

JOHN CLEESE:
Our religion is the first Church to cater for the naughty type of person. If you'd like a bit of 'love-your-neighbour' - and who doesn't now and again - then see Vera and Ciceley during the hymns.

DIRECTION:
Cut to wide-boy Pope, with small moustache and kipper tie. A sign says: 'No Questions Asked Religion '.

MICHAEL PALIN:
In our Church we try to help people to help themselves - to cars, washing machines, lead piping, no questions asked. We are the only Church, apart from the Baptists, to do respray jobs.

DIRECTION:
Cut to loony with a fright wig and an axe in his head. A sign says: 'The Lunatic Religion'.

TERRY JONES:
We at the Church of the Divine Loony believe in the power of prayer to turn the head purple ha, ha, ha.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a normal looking priest. A sign says: 'The Most Popular Religion Ltd'.

JOHN CLEESE:
I would like to come in here for a moment if I may, and disassociate our Church from these frivolous and offensive religions. We are primarily concerned with what is best...

DIRECTION:
phone rings; he answers it

DIRECTION:
puts phone down

JOHN CLEESE:
... for the human soul.

ANIMATION:

DIRECTION:

CAPTION: 'CARTOON RELIGIONS LTD'

DIRECTION:
In our Church we believe first and foremost in you.

DIRECTION:
use smiles; the top of his head comes off and the Devil tries to climb out; the vicar replaces his head

DIRECTION:
as before; the vicar nails the top of his head on

JOHN CLEESE:
In this picture there are forty people. None of them can be seen. In this film we hope to show how not to be seen.

DIRECTION:
CAPTION: 'HM GOVERNMENT, PUBLIC SERVICE FILM NO. 42 PARA 6. 'HOW NOT TO BE SEEN''

JOHN CLEESE:
This is Mr E. R. Bradshaw, of Napier Court, Black Lion Road, SE5. He cannot be seen. Now I'm going to ask him to stand up. Mr Bradshaw will you stand up please?

DIRECTION:
In the middle distance a smiling holidaymaker in braces, collarless shirt and hankie, stands up. There is a pause. Only the sound of the wind. Then a loud gunshot rings out. Mr. Bradshaw crumples to the ground

JOHN CLEESE:
This demonstrates the value of not being seen.

DIRECTION:
Cut to another location - an empty area of scrubland

JOHN CLEESE:
In this picture we canot see Mrs. B.J. Smegma of 13, The Cresent, Belmont. Mrs Smegma will you stand up please.

DIRECTION:
There is a pause. Almost on the edge of the frame in the distance a pepperpot stands up, proudly. Immediately a shot rings out and she leaps in the air and dies. Cut to a bush some distance awy on open land

JOHN CLEESE:
This is Mr Nesbitt of Harlow New Town. Mr Nesbit would you stand up please.

DIRECTION:
nothing happens

DIRECTION:
the bush explodes; cut to a shot of three bushes

DIRECTION:
the left-hand bush explodes, then the right-hand bush explodes, finally the middle bush explodes; there is a muffled scream; the smoke subsides

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes it was the middle one.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a shot of farmland. There is a waterbutt, a low wall, a big pile of leaves, a parked car and lots of bushes and trees in the distance

JOHN CLEESE:
Mr Ken Andrews, of Leighton Road, Slough, has concealed himself extremely well. He could be almost anywhere. He could be behind the wall, inside the water barrel, beneath a pile of leaves, up in the tree, squatting down behind the car, concealed in a hollow, or crouched behind any one of a hundred bushes. However we happen to know he's in the water barrel.

DIRECTION:
The water barrel just blows up in the biggest explosion yet. Cut to a panning shot from beach huts accross to beach and sea

JOHN CLEESE:
Mr. and Mrs. Watson of 'Ivy Cottage', Worplesdon Road, Hull, chose a very cunning way of not being seen. When we called at their house, we found that they had gone away on two weeks holiday. They had not left any forwading address, and they had bolted and barred the house to prevent us getting in. However a neighbour told us where there were.

DIRECTION:
The camera has come to rest on a very obvious isolated beach hut; it blows up. Cut to a building site in a suburban housing estate. There is a Gumby standing there.

JOHN CLEESE:
And here is the neighbour who told us where they were

DIRECTION:
