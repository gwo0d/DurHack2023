Yes, mothers, new improved Whizzo butter containing 10% more or less is absolutely indistinguishable from a dead crab. Remember, buy Whizzo butter and go to HEAVEN!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I can't tell the difference between Whizzo butter and this dead crab.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, you know, we find that nine out of ten British housewives can't tell the difference between Whizzo butter and a dead crab.

JOHN CLEESE:
Here. Here! You're on television, aren't you?

Yes, yes.

JOHN CLEESE:
He does the thing with one of those silly women who can't tell Whizzo butter from a dead crab.
