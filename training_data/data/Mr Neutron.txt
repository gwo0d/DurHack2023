MICHAEL PALIN:
But soon this quiet pattern of life was to change irrevocably. The commonplace routine of a typical Monday morning would never be the same again, for into this quiet little community came ... Mr Neutron!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Mr Neutron! The most dangerous and terrifying man in the world! The man with the strength of an army! The wisdom of all the scholars in history! The man who had the power to destroy the world.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Mr Neutron. No one knows what strange and distant planet he came from, or where he was going to!... Wherever he went, terror and destruction were sure to follow.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Mr Neutron! The man whose incredible power has made him the most feared man of all time... waits for his moment to destroy this little world utterly!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Then there's Stanley ... he's our eldest ... he's a biochemist in Sutton. He's married to Shirley...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Shirley who used to be the hairdresser?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, that's right, I think she's a lovely person.

MICHAEL PALIN:
My husband doesn't ... he thinks she's a bit flash.

TERRY JONES:
I hate 'er! I hate 'er guts.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And they, of course, they come down most weekends, so you'll be able to meet them then.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
l'd ... love ... to. Hairdressing is very interesting.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And very important, too. If you don't care for your scalp, you get rabies. Then there's Kenneth, he's our youngest. Mind you, he's a bit of a problem... at least my husband thinks he is, anyway.

TERRY JONES:
Nasty little piece of work, he is, I hate him!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Mind you, the one we hear so much about nowadays is Karen. She married a Canadian - he's a dentist - they live in Alberta - two lovely children, Gary who's three, Leslie who's six. They look like the spitting image of Karen. D'you want to see a photo ... ?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, yes please.

MICHAEL PALIN:
All right.

TERRY JONES:
They're a couple of little bastards. I hate 'em. They've got eyes like little pigs, just like their mother. She's a disaster ... a really horrible-looking person, she is. I thought that one would stay on the shelf, but along comes this stupid dentist git. He's a real creepy little bastard, he is. I hate 'im.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
This is a nice area.

TERRY JONES:
It's like a bloody graveyard. I hate it.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It's handy for the shops and convenient for the West End.

TERRY JONES:
If you like going to the West End. I think it's a stinking dump.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Meanwhile in Washington, at the headquarters of 'FEAR' - the Federal Egg Answering Room - in reality a front name for 'FEEBLE' - the Free World Extra-Earthly Bodies Location and Extermination Centre... all was not well.

ERIC IDLE:
Good God!

ERIC IDLE:
Get me the Supreme Commander Land, Sea and Air Forces, immediately!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hello?

ERIC IDLE:
This is Captain Carpenter sir, from FEAR.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You mean FEEBLE?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, sir ...

MICHAEL PALIN:
What is it?

ERIC IDLE:
Mr Neutron is missing, sir!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Mr Neutron! Oh my God! OK - Surround the entire city! Send in four waves of armed paratroopers with full ground-to-air missile support! Alert all air bases! Destroy all roads! We'll bomb the town flat if we have to!

ERIC IDLE:
Sir! Sir! He's not in Washington, sir.

MICHAEL PALIN:
OK! Hold everything! Hold everything! Hold it! Lay off! Lay off... Where is he?

ERIC IDLE:
We don't know, sir ... all we know is he checked out of his hotel and took a bus to the airport.

MICHAEL PALIN:
All right! I want a full-scale Red Alert throughout the world! Surround everyone with everything we've got! Mobilize every fighting unit and every weapon we can lay our hands on! I want... I want three full-scale global nuclear alerts with every army, navy and air force unit on eternal standby!

ERIC IDLE:
Right, sir!

MICHAEL PALIN:
And introduce conscription!

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, sir!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right!

MICHAEL PALIN:
So the world was in the grip of FEAR! A huge and terrifying crisis generated by one man!

MICHAEL PALIN:
... easily the most dangerous man the world has ever seen, honestly. Though still biding his time, he could strike at any moment. Could he be stopped in time?

ERIC IDLE:
You've got a bit of work to do there, then.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, it is a problem.

ERIC IDLE:
Mrs Ottershaw never used to bother ... then of course she was very old... she was 206! Well, must be going... if you need any help I'll send Frank round. He could do with a bit of'exercise, ha! ha! ha! ha! ... Fat old bastard...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes?

ERIC IDLE:
Captain Carpenter here, sir. We've been on red alert now for three days, sir, and still no sign of Mr Neutron.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Have we bombed anywhere? Have we shown 'em we got

MICHAEL PALIN:
?

ERIC IDLE:
Oh yes, sir. We've bombed a lot of places flat, sir.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good. Good. We don't want anyone to think we're chicken.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh no! They don't think that, sir. Everyone's really scared of us, sir.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Of us?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, sir.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Of our power?

ERIC IDLE:
Oh yes, sir! They're really scared when they see those big planes come over.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Wow! I bet they are. I bet they are. I bet they're really scared.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh they are, sir.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Do we have any figures on how scared they are?

ERIC IDLE:
No ... no figures, sir. But they sure were scared.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah! But it's not working?

ERIC IDLE:
No, sir.

MICHAEL PALIN:
OK. We'll try another tactic. We'll try and out-smart this Neutron guy. Yes, there's one man who could nail him.

ERIC IDLE:
One guy? That won't frighten anyone, sir.

MICHAEL PALIN:
He's the most brilliant man I ever met. We were in the CIA together. He's retired now. He breeds rabbits up in the Yukon... '

ERIC IDLE:
What's his name, sir?

MICHAEL PALIN:
His name is Teddy Salad.

ERIC IDLE:
Salad as in... ?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Lettuces, cucumber, radishes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

ERIC IDLE:
Where do I find him, sir?

MICHAEL PALIN:
The Yukon. Oh, and Carpenter ...

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, sir?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Make sure you get a decent disguise.
