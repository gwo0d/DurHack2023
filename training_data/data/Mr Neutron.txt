DIRECTION:
A train stops at the station. The train doors open and out steps Mr Neutron. He looks like an American footballer, with enormous shoulders, tapering to a thin waist. He has very regular features and piercing eyes and is most impressive. He stands at the door of the train for a moment. The words 'Mr Neutron' are written in bold diagonally across his chest. He carries a Sainsbury's shopping bag.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Mr Neutron! The most dangerous and terrifying man in the world! The man with the strength of an army! The wisdom of all the scholars in history! The man who had the power to destroy the world.

DIRECTION:
animation of planets in space

MICHAEL PALIN:
Mr Neutron. No one knows what strange and distant planet he came from, or where he was going to!... Wherever he went, terror and destruction were sure to follow.

DIRECTION:
Cut to Neutron's garden. He has three little picnic chairs out and is having tea with Mr and Mrs Entrail, a middle-aged couple. The lady, a little overdressed dominates. Mr Entrail sits there rather sourly.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Mr Neutron! The man whose incredible power has made him the most feared man of all time... waits for his moment to destroy this little world utterly!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Then there's Stanley ... he's our eldest ... he's a biochemist in Sutton. He's married to Shirley...

DIRECTION:
in a strange disembodied voice, grammatically correct but poor in intonation

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Shirley who used to be the hairdresser?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, that's right, I think she's a lovely person.

DIRECTION:
indicates her husband

MICHAEL PALIN:
My husband doesn't ... he thinks she's a bit flash.

TERRY JONES:
I hate 'er! I hate 'er guts.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And they, of course, they come down most weekends, so you'll be able to meet them then.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
l'd ... love ... to. Hairdressing is very interesting.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And very important, too. If you don't care for your scalp, you get rabies. Then there's Kenneth, he's our youngest. Mind you, he's a bit of a problem... at least my husband thinks he is, anyway.

TERRY JONES:
Nasty little piece of work, he is, I hate him!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Mind you, the one we hear so much about nowadays is Karen. She married a Canadian - he's a dentist - they live in Alberta - two lovely children, Gary who's three, Leslie who's six. They look like the spitting image of Karen. D'you want to see a photo ... ?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, yes please.

MICHAEL PALIN:
All right.

DIRECTION:
She goes to get a photograph.

TERRY JONES:
They're a couple of little bastards. I hate 'em. They've got eyes like little pigs, just like their mother. She's a disaster ... a really horrible-looking person, she is. I thought that one would stay on the shelf, but along comes this stupid dentist git. He's a real creepy little bastard, he is. I hate 'im.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
This is a nice area.

TERRY JONES:
It's like a bloody graveyard. I hate it.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It's handy for the shops and convenient for the West End.

TERRY JONES:
If you like going to the West End. I think it's a stinking dump.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a well-guarded American government building, with the letters 'FEAR' on a board outside.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Meanwhile in Washington, at the headquarters of 'FEAR' - the Federal Egg Answering Room - in reality a front name for 'FEEBLE' - the Free World Extra-Earthly Bodies Location and Extermination Centre... all was not well.

DIRECTION:
A high-security operations room - maps, charts. monitor screens. A message comes chattering over the teleprinter. A teleprinter operator rips it out and takes it over to Captain Carpenter who sits at a control desk.

ERIC IDLE:
Good God!

DIRECTION:
he grabs a red flashing phone

ERIC IDLE:
Get me the Supreme Commander Land, Sea and Air Forces, immediately!

DIRECTION:
Cut to a large room, empty apart from a very large desk with a large American eagle emblem above it. We hear American military music. There is nothing on the desk, except for a very futuristic, dynamic-looking intercom. Behind the desk the supreme commander sits. After a moment, slowly and rather surreptitiously, he sniffs his left armpit inside his jacket. Then, with a quick look around to see that no one is watching, he smells the other armpit. He sits up again, then cups his hand in front of his face to smell his breath. He looks worried still. He reaches down slowly and takes his shoe off. He has just brought it up to his nose when the intercorn buzzes loudly and a light flashes. The music stops. He jumps, and quickly takes his shoe off the desk. He presses a switch on the intercom.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hello?

ERIC IDLE:
This is Captain Carpenter sir, from FEAR.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You mean FEEBLE?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, sir ...

MICHAEL PALIN:
What is it?

ERIC IDLE:
Mr Neutron is missing, sir!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Mr Neutron! Oh my God! OK - Surround the entire city! Send in four waves of armed paratroopers with full ground-to-air missile support! Alert all air bases! Destroy all roads! We'll bomb the town flat if we have to!

ERIC IDLE:
Sir! Sir! He's not in Washington, sir.

MICHAEL PALIN:
OK! Hold everything! Hold everything! Hold it! Lay off! Lay off... Where is he?

ERIC IDLE:
We don't know, sir ... all we know is he checked out of his hotel and took a bus to the airport.

MICHAEL PALIN:
All right! I want a full-scale Red Alert throughout the world! Surround everyone with everything we've got! Mobilize every fighting unit and every weapon we can lay our hands on! I want... I want three full-scale global nuclear alerts with every army, navy and air force unit on eternal standby!

ERIC IDLE:
Right, sir!

MICHAEL PALIN:
And introduce conscription!

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, sir!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right!

DIRECTION:
He slams the intercom button down and sits there. Silence again. His eyes look from side to side then slowly he goes back to smelling himself.

MICHAEL PALIN:
So the world was in the grip of FEAR! A huge and terrifying crisis generated by one man!

DIRECTION:
zoom into Neutron in his front garden, weeding; behind him the group of GPO people are sitting opening another box fifty yards further down from the first one; a line of six recently opened boxes stretches up the road

MICHAEL PALIN:
... easily the most dangerous man the world has ever seen, honestly. Though still biding his time, he could strike at any moment. Could he be stopped in time?

DIRECTION:
A lady stops and chats to him.

ERIC IDLE:
You've got a bit of work to do there, then.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, it is a problem.

ERIC IDLE:
Mrs Ottershaw never used to bother ... then of course she was very old... she was 206! Well, must be going... if you need any help I'll send Frank round. He could do with a bit of'exercise, ha! ha! ha! ha! ... Fat old bastard...

DIRECTION:
She walks off. Neutron goes back to his weeding. Cut back to the supreme commander's office. He is sniffing himself again, only this time he has his whole shirt front pulled up and he is trying to smell under his shirt. The intercom goes. He quickly tucks his shirt in and depresses the switch.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes?

ERIC IDLE:
Captain Carpenter here, sir. We've been on red alert now for three days, sir, and still no sign of Mr Neutron.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Have we bombed anywhere? Have we shown 'em we got

DIRECTION:
teeth

MICHAEL PALIN:
?

ERIC IDLE:
Oh yes, sir. We've bombed a lot of places flat, sir.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good. Good. We don't want anyone to think we're chicken.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh no! They don't think that, sir. Everyone's really scared of us, sir.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Of us?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, sir.

DIRECTION:
pleased

MICHAEL PALIN:
Of our power?

ERIC IDLE:
Oh yes, sir! They're really scared when they see those big planes come over.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Wow! I bet they are. I bet they are. I bet they're really scared.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh they are, sir.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Do we have any figures on how scared they are?

ERIC IDLE:
No ... no figures, sir. But they sure were scared.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah! But it's not working?

ERIC IDLE:
No, sir.

MICHAEL PALIN:
OK. We'll try another tactic. We'll try and out-smart this Neutron guy. Yes, there's one man who could nail him.

ERIC IDLE:
One guy? That won't frighten anyone, sir.

MICHAEL PALIN:
He's the most brilliant man I ever met. We were in the CIA together. He's retired now. He breeds rabbits up in the Yukon... '

ERIC IDLE:
What's his name, sir?

MICHAEL PALIN:
His name is Teddy Salad.

ERIC IDLE:
Salad as in... ?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Lettuces, cucumber, radishes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

ERIC IDLE:
Where do I find him, sir?

MICHAEL PALIN:
The Yukon. Oh, and Carpenter ...

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, sir?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Make sure you get a decent disguise.
