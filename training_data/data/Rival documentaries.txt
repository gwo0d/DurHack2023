Cut to a documentary producer standing in forested hillside.

JOHN CLEESE:
Was Sir Walter Scott a loony, or was he the greatest flowering of the early nineteenth-century romantic tradition? The most underestimated novelist of the nineteenth century...

DIRECTION:
another introducer of documentaries comes into shot and walks up to the first

JOHN CLEESE:

MICHAEL PALIN:
Excuse me ...

MICHAEL PALIN:
The Forestry Commission systematically replanted this entire area...

DIRECTION:
The first producer follows behind.

JOHN CLEESE:
Excuse me.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Sh! That's forty thousand acres of virgin forest. By 1980 this will have risen to two hundred thousand acres of soft woods. In commercial terms, a coniferous cornucopia... an evergreen El Dorado...

DIRECTION:
the first producer runs and makes a feeble grab for the mike

MICHAEL PALIN:
... a tree-lined treasure trove ... No ... a fat fir-coned future for the financiers ... but what of the cost ...

JOHN CLEESE:
It's mine!

DIRECTION:
to first producer

MICHAEL PALIN:
Go away ... in human terms? Who are the casualties?

DIRECTION:
The first producer makes a lunge and grabs the mike. He stops and the camera stops with him.

JOHN CLEESE:
For this was Sir Walter Scott's country. Many of his finest romances, such as 'Guy Mannering' and 'Redgauntlet'...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Give that back!

JOHN CLEESE:
No.

DIRECTION:
they grapple a bit. The first producer just manages to keep hold of it as he goes down onto the ground

JOHN CLEESE:
Scott showed himself to be not only a fine...

DIRECTION:
The second producer manages to grab the mike and runs off leaving the first producer on the ground. The camera follows the second producer.

The spruces and flowers of this forest will be used to create a whole new industry here in...

DIRECTION:
They are both fighting and rolling around on the ground.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Britain's timber resources are being used up at a rate of...

DIRECTION:
The first producer hits him, and grabs the mike.

JOHN CLEESE:
One man who knew Scott was Angus Tinker.

DIRECTION:
A sunlit university quad with classical pillars. Gentle classical music. Tinker is standing next to one of the pillars. He is a tweed-suited academic.

DIRECTION:
CAPTION: 'ANGUS TINKER'

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Much of Scott's greatest work, and I'm thinking here particularly of 'Heart of Midlothian' and 'Old Mortality' for example, was concerned with...

DIRECTION:
at this point a hand appears from behind the pillar and starts to go slowly but surely for the mike

DIRECTION:
the mike is grabbed away from him

TERRY JONES:
Forestry research here has shown that the wholly synthetic soft timber fibre can be created...

TERRY JONES:
This new soft-timber fibre would totally replace the plywoods, hardboards and chipboards at present dominating the...

DIRECTION:
A Morris Minor speeds up round the quad and passes straight in front of the expert and the first producer's hand comes out and grabs the mike. Cut to interior of the Morris Minor as it speeds out of quad and out into country. The first producer keeps glancing nervously over shoulder.

JOHN CLEESE:
In the Waverley novels... Scott was constantly concerned to protect a way of life...

He ducks as we hear the sound of a bullet ricochet from the car. Cut to shot through the back window. The second producer is chasing in a huge open American 1930's gangster car driven by a chauffeur in a thirties kit. He is shooting.

JOHN CLEESE:
....safeguarding nationalist traditions and aspiration, within the necessary limitations of the gothic novel...

DIRECTION:
More bullets. The American car draws level. The second producer leans over trying to grab the mike. Still attempting to say their lines, both of them scramble for the microphone as the cars race along. Eventually the cars disappear round a corner and we hear a crash.

DIRECTION:
Cut to Toogood, surrounded by people, holding the book very close to his face and peering closely at the print. MacDonald lies on the floor in front of them.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Then... theen... the... the end! The End.

DIRECTION:

DIRECTION:
Cut to film (no sound) of Edward Heath. The 'Spot the Loony' buzzer goes. Roll credits. Cut to BBC world symbol.
