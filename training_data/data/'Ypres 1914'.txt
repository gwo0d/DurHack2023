MICHAEL PALIN:
Jenkins.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, sarge?

MICHAEL PALIN:
What are you going to do when you get back to Blighty?

ERIC IDLE:
I dunno, sarge. I expect I'll look after my mum. She'll be getting on a bit now.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Got a family of your own, have you?

ERIC IDLE:
No - she's all I got left now. My wife, Doreen ... she... I got a letter.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You don't have to tell me, son.

ERIC IDLE:
No, sarge, I'd like to tell you. You see, this bloke from up the street...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
OK, chaps, at ease. I've just been up the line...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Can we get through, sir?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, I'm afraid we'll have to make a break for it at nightfall.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right, sir. We're all with yer.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes I know, that's just the problem, sergeant. How many are there of us?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well there's you, me, Jenkins, Padre, Kipper, there's five, sir.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
And only rations for...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Four, sir.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Precisely. I'm afraid one of us will have to take the 'other' way out.

JOHN CLEESE:
I'm a gonner, major. Leave me, I'm ... I'm not a complete man anymore.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You've lost both your arms as well.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes. Damn silly really.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no, we'll draw for it. That's the way we do things in the army. Sergeant, the straws!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Right now, the man who gets the shortest straw knows what to do

MICHAEL PALIN:
Looks like you, sir.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Is it? What did we say, the longest straw was it?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, shortest, sir.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well we'd better do it again, there's obviously been a bit of a muddle.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, this is not working out. It's not working out. What shall we do?

ERIC IDLE:
How about one potato, two potato, sir?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Don't be childish, Jenkins. No, I think, I think fisties would be best. OK, so hands behind backs. After three, OK, one, two, three.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
and scissors. Now. Scissors cut everything, don't they?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Not stone, sir.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
They're very good scissors

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Padre hasn't been!

MICHAEL PALIN:
No arms, sir.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, I'm terribly sorry, I'm afraid I didn't... tell you what. All those people who don't want to stay here and shoot themselves raise their arms.

JOHN CLEESE:
Stop it! Stop it! Stop this ... this hideous fa√ßade.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Easy, padre!

JOHN CLEESE:
No, no, I must speak. When I, when I came to this war, I had two arms, two good arms, but when the time came to... to lose one, I .. I gave it gladly, I smiled as they cut if off,
