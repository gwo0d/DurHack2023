ERIC IDLE:
!?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hello again, now here's a little sketch by two boys from London town. They've been writing for three years and they've called this little number - here it is, it's called - Restaurant sketch.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
It's nice here, isn't it?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, very good restaurant, three stars you know.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Really?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Mmm...

TERRY JONES:
Good evening, sir! Good evening, madam! And may I say what a pleasure it is to see you here again, sir!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh thank you. Well there you are dear. Have a look there, anything you like. The boeuf en croute is fantastic.

TERRY JONES:
Oh if I may suggest, sir ... the pheasant Ã  la reine, the sauce is one of the chefs most famous creations.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Em... that sounds good. Anyway just have a look... take your time. Oh, er by the way - got a bit of a dirty fork, could you ... er.. get me another one?

TERRY JONES:
I beg your pardon.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh it's nothing ... er, I've got a fork a little bit dirty. Could you get me another one? Thank you.

TERRY JONES:
Oh ... sir, I do apologize.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, no need to apologize, it doesn't worry me.

TERRY JONES:
Oh no, no, no, I do apologize. I will fetch the head waiter immediatement.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, there's no need to do that!

TERRY JONES:
Oh, no no... I'm sure the head waiter, he will want to apologize to you himself. I will fetch him at once.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Well, you certainly get good service here.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
They really look after you... yes.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Excuse me monsieur and madame.

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's filthy, Gaston ... find out who washed this up, and give them their cards immediately.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, no, no.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Better still, we can't afford to take any chances, sack the entire washing-up staff.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, look I don't want to make any trouble.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, no please, no trouble. It's quite right that you should point these kind of things out. Gaston, tell the manager what has happened immediately!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, no I don't want to cause any fuss.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Please, it's no fuss. I quite simply wish to ensure that nothing interferes with your complete enjoyment of the meal.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh I'm sure it won't, it was only a dirty fork.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I know. And I'm sorry, bitterly sorry, but I know that... no apologies I can make can alter the fact that in our restaurant you have been given a dirty, filthy, smelly piece of cutlery...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It wasn't smelly.

MICHAEL PALIN:
It was smelly, and obscene and disgusting and I hate it, I hate it ,.. nasty, grubby, dirty, mingy, scrubby little fork. Oh ... oh . . . oh . . .

ERIC IDLE:
Good evening, sir, good evening, madam. I am the manager. I've only just heard . .. may I sit down?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, of course.

ERIC IDLE:
I want to apologize, humbly, deeply, and sincerely about the fork.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh please, it's only a tiny bit... I couldn't see it.

ERIC IDLE:
Ah you're good kind fine people, for saying that, but I can see it.., to me it's like a mountain, a vast bowl of pus.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It's not as bad as that.

ERIC IDLE:
It gets me

ERIC IDLE:
things aren't going very well back there. The poor cook's son has been put away again, and poor old Mrs Dalrymple who does the washing up can hardly move her poor fingers, and then there's Gilberto's war wound - but they're good people, and they're kind people, and together we were beginning to get over this dark patch ... there was light at the end of the tunnel . .. now this . .. now this...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Can I get you some water?

ERIC IDLE:
It's the end of the road!!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Easy, Mungo, easy... Mungo...

MICHAEL PALIN:
the war wound!... the wound... the wound...

ERIC IDLE:
This is the end! The end! Aaargh!!

JOHN CLEESE:
They've destroyed him! He's dead!! They killed him!!!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Lucky we didn't say anything about the dirty knife.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, there we are then, that was the restaurant sketch, a nice little number...a bit vicious in parts, but a lot of fun...but how about that punch line, eh?...Oh, you know what I mean - oh...oh...really.
