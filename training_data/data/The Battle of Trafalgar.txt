GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What makes you think the Battle of Trafalgar was fought near Cudworth?

DIRECTION:
There is a long pause.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Because ... Drake ... was ... too ... clever for... the German ... fleet.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I beg your pardon?

... Oh I've forgotten what I said now.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
The stuff of history is indeed woven in the woof. Pearl Harbour. There are pages in history's book which are written on the grand scale. Events so momentous that they dwarf man and time alike. And such is the Battle of Pearl Harbour, re-enacted for us now by the women of Barley Townswomen's Guild.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a muddy corner of a field. Miss Rita Fairbanks stands talking straight to camera. Behind her lurk five more pepperpots.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Miss Rita Fairbanks - you organized this reconstruction of the Battle of Pearl Harbour - why?

ERIC IDLE:
Well we've always been extremely interested in modern drama ... we were of course the first Townswomen's Guild to perform 'Camp On Blood Island', and last year we did our extremely popular re-enactment of 'Nazi War Atrocities'. So this year we thought we would like to do something in a lighter vein...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
So you chose the Battle of Pearl Harbour?

ERIC IDLE:

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well I can see you're all ready to go. So I'll just wish you good luck in your latest venture.

ERIC IDLE:
Thank you very much, young man.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
