GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
The cat sat on the mat. And now the Battle of Trafalgar...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Tonight we examine popular views of this great battle. Was the Battle of Trafalgar fought in the Atlantic off southern Spain? Or was it fought on dry land near Cudworth in Yorkshire? Here is one man who thinks it was...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
And here is his friend.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What makes you think the Battle of Trafalgar was fought near Cudworth?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Because ... Drake ... was ... too ... clever for... the German ... fleet.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I beg your pardon?

MICHAEL PALIN:
... Oh I've forgotten what I said now.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Mr Gumby's remarkable views have sparked off a wave of controversy amongst his fellow historians.

ERIC IDLE:
Well I rink ... we ... should ... reappraise ... our concept of the ... Battle of Trafalgar.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well... well... I agree with everything Mr Gumby says.

The stuff of history is indeed woven in the woof. Pearl Harbour. There are pages in history's book which are written on the grand scale. Events so momentous that they dwarf man and time alike. And such is the Battle of Pearl Harbour, re-enacted for us now by the women of Barley Townswomen's Guild.

ERIC IDLE:

So this year we thought we would like to do something in a lighter vein...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
So you chose the Battle of Pearl Harbour?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, that's right, we did.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well I can see you're all ready to go. So I'll just wish you good luck in your latest venture.

ERIC IDLE:
Thank you very much, young man.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ladies and gentlemen, the World of History is proud to present the premiere of the Batley Townswomen's Guild's re-enactment of 'The Battle of Pearl Harbour'.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
The Battle of Pearl Harbour. Incidentally, I'm sorry if I got a little bit shirty earlier on in the programme, when I kept getting interrupted by all these films and things that kept coming in, but I...
