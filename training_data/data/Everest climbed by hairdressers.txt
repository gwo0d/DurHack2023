MICHAEL PALIN:
Mount Everest. Forbidding. Aloof. Terrifying. The mountain with the biggest tits in the world.

ERIC IDLE:
Start again!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Mount Everest. Forbidding. Aloof. Terrifying. This year, this remote Himalayan mountain, this mystical temple, surrounded by the most difficult terrain in the world, repulsed yet another attempt to conquer it. This time, by the International Hairdresser's Expedition.

MICHAEL PALIN:
In such freezing, adverse conditions, man comes very close to breaking point. What was the real cause of the disharmony which destroyed their chances at success?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, people would keep taking my hairdryer and never returning it.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
There was a lot of bitching in the tents.

ERIC IDLE:
You couldn't get near the mirror.

MICHAEL PALIN:
The leader of the expedition was Colonel Sir John 'Teasy-Weasy' Butler, veteran of K2, Annapurna, and Vidals. His plan was to ignore the usual route around the South Col and to make straight for the top.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
We established base salon here,

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
From here using crampons and cutting ice steps as we went, we moved steadily up the Lhotse Face to the North Ridge, establishing camp three where we could get a hot meal, a manicure, and a shampoo and set.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Could it work? Could this eighteen-year old hairdresser from Brixton succeed where others had failed? The situation was complicated by the imminent arrival of the monsoon storms. Patrice takes up the story.

ERIC IDLE:
Well, we knew as well as anyone that the monsoons were due, but the thing was, Ricky and I had just had a blow dry and rinse, and we couldn't go out for a couple of days.

MICHAEL PALIN:
After a blazing row, the Germans and Italians had turned back, taking with them the last of the hair nets. On the third day a blizzard blew up.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Temperatures fell to minus thirty centigrade. Inside the little tent, things were getting desperate.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, things have got so bad that we've been forced to use the last of the heavy oxygen equipment just to keep the dryers going.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, she's a treas.

MICHAEL PALIN:
But a new factor had entered the race. A team of French chiropodists, working with brand new cornplasters and Doctor Scholl's Mountaineering Sandals, were covering ground fast. The Glasgow Orpheus Male Voice Choir were tackling the difficult North Col.

MICHAEL PALIN:
were at his heels. This was it. Ricky had to make a decision.

ERIC IDLE:
Well, he decided to open a salon.

MICHAEL PALIN:
It was a tremendous success.

ERIC IDLE:
Challenging Everest? Why not drop in at Ricky Pules' - only 24,000 feet from this cinema. Ricky and Maurice offer a variety of styles for the well-groomed climber. Like Sherpa Tensing and Sir Edmond Hillary be number one on top, when you're Number One on Top?
