ERIC IDLE:
And now a dormitory in a girls' public school.

DIRECTION:
Noise of female snores. Sound of a window sash being lifted and scrabbling sounds. Padding feet across the dorm.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hello, Agnes... Agnes are you awake? Agnes....

DIRECTION:
Sound of waking up. More padding feet.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Agnes...

ERIC IDLE:
Who is it ... is that you, Charlie?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yeah... Agnes, where's Jane?

TERRY
JONES:
I'm over here, Charlie.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Jane, we're going down to raid the tuck shop.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh good oh ... count me in, girls.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Can I come, too, Agnes?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yeah, Joyce.

DIRECTION:
And me and Avril...

TERRY
JONES:
Yeah, rather... and Suki.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, whacko the diddle-oh.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Cave girls... Here comes Miss Rodgers...

DIRECTION:
Light goes on to reveal a girls' dorm. In the middle of the floor between the beds are two panto geese which run off immediately the light goes on. There is one man in a string vest and short dibley haircut, chest wig, schoolgirl's skirt, white socks and schoolgirl's shoes. Hanging from the middle of the ceiling is a goat with light bulbs hanging from each foot. In the beds are other batch blokes in string vests... and short hair. At the door stands a commando-type Miss Rodgers.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
All right girls, now stop this tomfoolery and get back to bed, remember it's the big match at St Bridget's tomorrow.

DIRECTION:
Cut to still of one of us in the uniform as described above.

DIRECTION:
SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'THE NAUGHTIEST GIRL IN THE SCHOOL'
