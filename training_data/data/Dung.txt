DIRECTION:
Cut to a smart dinner party. There are two couples in evening dress at the table. Candles burning on the polished wood, a fire burning in the grate. Muted music and sophisticated lighting.

RITA DAVIES:
We had the most marvelous holiday. It was absolutely fantastic.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Absolutely wonderful.

DIRECTION:
Michael, you tell them about it.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, darling, you tell them.

DIRECTION:
You do it so much better.

DIRECTION:
The doorbell rings.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Excuse me a moment.

DIRECTION:
The host goes and answers the door of the flat, which opens straight into the dining room. Standing at the door is a large grubby man carrying a tub on his shoulder. There are flies buzzing around him. He walks straight in.

JOHN CLEESE:
Dung, sir.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What?

JOHN CLEESE:
We've got your dung.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What dung?

JOHN CLEESE:
Your dung. Three hundredweight of heavy droppings. Where do you want it?

DIRECTION:
he looks round for a likely place

MICHAEL PALIN:
I didn't order any dung.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes you did, sir. You ordered it through the Book of the Month Club.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Book of the Month Club?

JOHN CLEESE:
That's right, sir. You get 'Gone with the Wind', 'Les Miserables' by Victor Hugo, 'The French Lieutenant's Woman' and with every third book you get dung.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I didn't know that when I signed the form.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, no, no. It wasn't on the form - they found it wasn't good for business. Anyway, we've got three hundredweight of dung in the van. Where do you want it?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, I don't think we do. We've no garden.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, it'll all fit in here - it's top-class excrement.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You can't put it in here, we've having a dinner party!

JOHN CLEESE:
'Salright. I'll put it on the telly.

DIRECTION:
He brings it into the dining room. The guests ignore him.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Darling... there's a man here with our Book of the Month Club dung.

DIRECTION:
We've no room, dear.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, how many rooms have you got, then?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, there's only this room, the bedroom, a spare room.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh well, I'll tell you what, move everything into the main bedroom, then you can use the spare room as a dung room.
