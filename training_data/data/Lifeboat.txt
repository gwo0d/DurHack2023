taking off his sou'wester and shaking the water off it

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh it's terrible up on deck.

TERRY JONES:
Up on deck?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes on deck. It's diabolical weather.

TERRY JONES:
What deck, dear?

MICHAEL PALIN:
The deck, The deck of the lifeboat.

TERRY JONES:
This isn't a lifeboat, dear. This is 24, Parker Street.

MICHAEL PALIN:
This is the Newhaven Lifeboat.

TERRY JONES:
No it's not, dear.

DIRECTION:
The First Lifeboatman puts on his sou'wester, goes over to the back door and opens it, He peers out. Sound of wind and lashing rain. Cut to the back door at the side of a suburban home, the lifeboatman looking out over the lawns, flowers and windless, rainless calm across to similar neat suburban houses. The noise cuts. The liftboatman withdraws his head from the door. Sound of wind and rain again which cease abruptly as he withdraws his head and shuts the door.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You're right. This isn't a lifeboat at all.

TERRY JONES:
No, I wouldn't live here if it was,

MICHAEL PALIN:
Do you mind if I sit down for a minute and collect my wits?

TERRY JONES:
No, you do that, I'll make you a nice cup of tea.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Thanks very much.

DIRECTION:
The door flies open. More sound of wind and rain. Two other rain-soaked lifeboatmen appear.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oooh, it's a wild night up top.

TERRY GILLIAM:
Your turn on deck soon, Charlie.

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's not a lifeboat, Frank.

TERRY GILLIAM:
What?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What do you mean?

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's not a lifeboat. It's this lady's house.

DIRECTION:
The two lifeboatmen look at each other, then turn and open the door. Sound of wind and rain as usual. They peer out. Cut to the back door - the two lifeboatmen are peering out. They shout.

DIRECTION:
Captain! Captain! Ahoy there! Ahoy there! Captain!!
