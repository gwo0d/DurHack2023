MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh it's terrible up on deck.

TERRY JONES:
Up on deck?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes on deck. It's diabolical weather.

TERRY JONES:
What deck, dear?

MICHAEL PALIN:
The deck, The deck of the lifeboat.

TERRY JONES:
This isn't a lifeboat, dear. This is 24, Parker Street.

MICHAEL PALIN:
This is the Newhaven Lifeboat.

TERRY JONES:
No it's not, dear.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You're right. This isn't a lifeboat at all.

TERRY JONES:
No, I wouldn't live here if it was,

MICHAEL PALIN:
Do you mind if I sit down for a minute and collect my wits?

TERRY JONES:
No, you do that, I'll make you a nice cup of tea.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Thanks very much.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oooh, it's a wild night up top.

TERRY GILLIAM:
Your turn on deck soon, Charlie.

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's not a lifeboat, Frank.

TERRY GILLIAM:
What?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What do you mean?

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's not a lifeboat. It's this lady's house.
