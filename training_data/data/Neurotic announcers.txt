Cut to the BBC world symbol again and hold throughout the following dialogue.

DIRECTION:
voice over

ERIC IDLE:
Good evening, we interrupt this programme again, a) to irritate you and, b) to provide work for one of our announcers.

DIRECTION:
voice over

JOHN CLEESE:
Good evening, I'm the announcer who's just been given this job by the BBC and I'd just like to say how grateful I am to the BBC for providing me with work, particularly at this time of year, when things are a bit thin for us announcers... um... I don't know whether I should tell you this, but, well, I have been going through a rather tough time recently. Things have been pretty awful at home. My wife, Josephine... 'Joe-jums' as I call her ... who is also an announcer...

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Hello.

JOHN CLEESE:
... has not been able to announce since our youngest, Clifford, was born, and, well,

DIRECTION:
tearfully

DIRECTION:
he starts to sob

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hello, I'm another announcer, my name's Dick. Joe-jums just rang me and said Jack was having a bad time with this announcement, so I've just come to give him a hand. How is he, Joe-jums?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Pretty bad, Dick.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Jack... it's Dick... Do you want me to make the announcement?

JOHN CLEESE:
No, no Dick. I must do it myself...

DIRECTION:
emotionally

JOHN CLEESE:
it's my last chance with the BBC, I can't throw it away... I've got to do it ... for Joe-jums... for the kids... I've got to go through with it...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good man. Now remember your announcer's training: deep breaths, and try not to think about what you're saying...

JOHN CLEESE:
Good evening. This

DIRECTION:
a trace of superhuman effort in his voice

JOHN CLEESE:
is BBC 1...

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Good luck, Jack.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Keep going, old boy.

JOHN CLEESE:
It's... nine o'clock... and... time... for... the News... read by... Richard Baker.

DIRECTION:
Cut to start of the 'Nine O'Clock News '.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
You've done it.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Congratulations, old man!

DIRECTION:
Richard Baker is sitting at a desk. As Richard Baker speaks we hear no sounds apart from the sounds of celebration of the announcers - champagne corks popping, etc. At the beginning of the news Baker uses the gesture between sentences that we have seen Mr Orbiter use, plus other gestures. Behind him on the screen a collage of photos appear one after the other: Richard Nixon, Tony Armstrong-Jones, the White House, Princess Margaret, parliament, naked breasts, a scrubbing brush, a man with a stoat through his head, Margaret Thatcher, a lavatory, a Scotsman lying on his back with his knees drawn up, a corkscrew, Edward Heath, a pair of false teeth in a glass. Whilst these have been going on Baker has been making gestures starting with elbow-up gesture and getting progressively more obscure and intriguing. We don't hear him at all, we hear all the announcers having a party and congratulating Jack.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Fantastic darling, you were brilliant. No, no, it was the best you ever did.

JOHN CLEESE:
Thank God.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
It was absolutely super.

MICHAEL PALIN:
... have a drink. For God's sake drink this...

JOHN CLEESE:
Fantastic.

MICHAEL PALIN:
The least I could do - super - I must come over.

JOHN CLEESE:
I can't tell you how much that means.

DIRECTION:
etc.
