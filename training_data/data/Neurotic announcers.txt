ERIC IDLE:
Good evening, we interrupt this programme again, a) to irritate you and, b) to provide work for one of our announcers.

JOHN CLEESE:
Good evening, I'm the announcer who's just been given this job by the BBC and I'd just like to say how grateful I am to the BBC for providing me with work, particularly at this time of year, when things are a bit thin for us announcers... um... I don't know whether I should tell you this, but, well, I have been going through a rather tough time recently. Things have been pretty awful at home. My wife, Josephine... 'Joe-jums' as I call her ... who is also an announcer...

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Hello.

JOHN CLEESE:
... has not been able to announce since our youngest, Clifford, was born, and, well,

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hello, I'm another announcer, my name's Dick. Joe-jums just rang me and said Jack was having a bad time with this announcement, so I've just come to give him a hand. How is he, Joe-jums?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Pretty bad, Dick.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Jack... it's Dick... Do you want me to make the announcement?

JOHN CLEESE:
No, no Dick. I must do it myself...

JOHN CLEESE:
it's my last chance with the BBC, I can't throw it away... I've got to do it ... for Joe-jums... for the kids... I've got to go through with it...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good man. Now remember your announcer's training: deep breaths, and try not to think about what you're saying...

JOHN CLEESE:
Good evening. This

JOHN CLEESE:
is BBC 1...

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Good luck, Jack.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Keep going, old boy.

JOHN CLEESE:
It's... nine o'clock... and... time... for... the News... read by... Richard Baker.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
You've done it.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Congratulations, old man!

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Fantastic darling, you were brilliant. No, no, it was the best you ever did.

JOHN CLEESE:
Thank God.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
It was absolutely super.

MICHAEL PALIN:
... have a drink. For God's sake drink this...

JOHN CLEESE:
Fantastic.

MICHAEL PALIN:
The least I could do - super - I must come over.

JOHN CLEESE:
I can't tell you how much that means.
