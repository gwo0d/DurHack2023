TERRY JONES:
No, no, no.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Did he have his head all bandaged?

No, it wasn't like that. They had lots of lights and cameras and tape recorders and all that sort of thing.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, that'll be Ray Baxter and the boys and girls from 'Tomorrow's World'. Oh, I prefer Reginald Bosanquet, there's not so many of them.
