TERRY JONES:
There will now be a whopping great intermission, during which small ice creams in very large boxes will be sold. Another way we can drive people away from the cinema is by showing you advertisements.

ERIC IDLE:
Do you like this? Or how about this? Or perhaps you prefer this latest model. Then why not come to us. We supply only the very best models.

JOHN CLEESE:
Albatross! Albatross! Albatross!

TERRY JONES:
Two choc-ices please.

JOHN CLEESE:
I haven't got choc-ices. I only got the albatross. Albatross!

TERRY JONES:
What flavour is it?

JOHN CLEESE:
It's a bird, innit? It's a bloody sea bird . .. it's not any bloody flavour. Albatross!

TERRY JONES:
Do you get wafers with it?

JOHN CLEESE:
Course you don't get bloody wafers with it. Albatross!

TERRY JONES:
How much is it?

JOHN CLEESE:
Ninepence.

TERRY JONES:
I'll have two please.

JOHN CLEESE:
Gannet on a stick.

TERRY JONES:
There will now be a very short...

TERRY JONES:
Well that's quite enough of that. And now a policeman near Rottingdeans ... Albatross!
