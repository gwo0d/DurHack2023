JOHN CLEESE:
Good evening. Tonight we're going to take a hard tough abrasive look at camel spotting. Hello.

ERIC IDLE:
Hello Peter.

JOHN CLEESE:
Now tell me, what exactly are you doing?

ERIC IDLE:
Er well, I'm camel spotting. I'm spotting to see if there are any camels that I can spot, and put them down in my camel spotting book.

JOHN CLEESE:
Good. And how many camels have you spotted so far?

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, well so far Peter, up to the present moment, I've spotted nearly, ooh, nearly one.

JOHN CLEESE:
Nearly one?

ERIC IDLE:
Er, call it none.

JOHN CLEESE:
Fine. And er how long have you been here?

ERIC IDLE:
Three years.

JOHN CLEESE:
So, in, er, three years you've spotted no camels?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes in only three years. Er, I tell a lie, four, be fair, five. I've been camel spotting for just the seven years. Before that of course I was a Yeti spotter.

JOHN CLEESE:
A Yeti spotter, that must have been extremely interesting.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, it was extremely interesting, very, very - quite... it was dull; dull, dull, dull, oh God it was dull. Sitting in the Waterloo waiting room. Course once you've seen one Yeti you've seen them all.

JOHN CLEESE:
And have you seen them all?

ERIC IDLE:
Well I've seen one. Well a little one... a picture of a... I've heard about them.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, now tell me, what do you do when you spot a camel?

ERIC IDLE:
Er, I take its number.

JOHN CLEESE:
Camels don't have numbers.

ERIC IDLE:
Ah, well you've got to know where to look. Er, they're on the side of the engine above the piston box.

JOHN CLEESE:
What?

ERIC IDLE:
Ah - of course you've got to make sure it's not a dromedary. 'Cos if it's a dromedary it goes in the dromedary book.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well how do you tell if it's a dromedary?

ERIC IDLE:
Ah well, a dromedary has one hump and a camel has a refreshment car, buffet, and ticket collector.

JOHN CLEESE:
Mr Sopwith, aren't you in fact a train spotter?

ERIC IDLE:
What?

JOHN CLEESE:
Don't you in fact spot trains?
