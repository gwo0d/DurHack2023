Coming right up - the theatre sketch - so don't move!

DIRECTION:
The front stalls of a theatre. It is a first night - a lot of people in dinner jackets etc. About three rows back there is a spare seat. A general rustle of programmes, chocolates and theatrical murmurs. Suddenly a Sioux Indian enters, clad only in loin cloth, wearing war paint and with a single strip of hair in the middle of his head and feather. He carries a bow and a quiver of arrows. He settles into the empty seat. The man next to him shifts uneasily and looks straight ahead. The Indian looks his neighbour up and down a couple of times.

DIRECTION:
always speaking with full gestures

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:

Ladies and gentlemen. Before the play starts, I would like to apologize to you all, but unfortunately Miss Cicely Courtneidge is unable to appear, owing to...

DIRECTION:
He is suddenly struck in the chest by first one arrow and then another. He crumbles to the ground revealing half a dozen in his back. The air is filled with war-whoops and drum beats and screams. Cut to a working-class kitchen.

DIRECTION:
reading newspaper

TERRY JONES:
D'you read that, Edgar?

IAN DAVIDSON:
What's that dear?

TERRY JONES:
There's been another Indian massacre at Dorking Civic Theatre.

DIRECTION:
About time too dear...

TERRY JONES:
'Those who were left alive at the end got their money back'.

DIRECTION:
That's what live theatre needs - a few more massacres...

TERRY JONES:
'The police are anxious to speak to anyone who saw the crime, ladies with large breasts, or just anyone who likes policemen.'

Suddenly a policeman walks in between the couple and the camera.

Yes! Policemen make wonderful friends. So if you are over six feet tall and would like a friend, a pen friend, in the police force, here is the address to write to: 'Mrs Ena Frog, 8 Masonic Apron Street, Cowdenbeath'. Remember - policemen make wonderful friends. So write today and take advantage of our free officer. Thank you. And now for the next sketch.

DIRECTION:
The policeman removes his helmet, shakes it, proffers it to mum at the table. She takes out a small folded bit of paper, opens and reads.
