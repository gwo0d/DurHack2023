DIRECTION:
Cut to Raymond Baxter type standing in front of map. A small cardboard cut-out of Picasso's face is on map and is moved around to illustrate route.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well Picasso will be starting, David, at Chichester here, he'll then cycle on the A29 to Fontwell, he'll then take the A272 which will bring him on to the A3 just north of Hindhead here. From then on Pablo has a straight run on the A3 until he meets the South Circular at Battersea here. Well, this is a truly remarkable occasion as it is the first time that a modern artist of such stature has taken the A272, and it'll be very interesting to see how he copes with the heavy traffic round Wisborough Green. Vicky.

DIRECTION:
Cut to Vicky, holding a bicycle.

ERIC IDLE:
Well Picasso will be riding his Viking Super Roadster with the drop handlebars and the dual-thread wheel-rims and with his Wiley-Prat 20-1 synchro-mesh he should experience difficulties on the sort of road surfaces they just don't get abroad. Mitzie.

DIRECTION:
Cut to linkman at desk with Viking on one side and a knight in armour on the other.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And now for the latest report on Picasso's progress over to Reg Moss on the Guildford by-pass.

DIRECTION:
Reg Moss standing with hand mike by fairly busy road.

ERIC IDLE:
Well there's no sign of Picasso at the moment, David. But he should be through here at any moment. However I do have with me Mr Ron Geppo, British Cycling Sprint Champion and this year's winner of the Derby-Doncaster rally.

DIRECTION:
Geppo is in full cyclist's kit.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well Reg, I think Pablo should be all right provided he doesn't attempt anything on the monumental scale of some of his earlier paintings, like Guernica or Mademoiselles d'Avignon or even his later War and Peace murals for the Temple of Peace chapel at Vallauris, because with this strong head wind I don't think even Doug Timpson of Manchester Harriers could paint anything on that kind of scale.

ERIC IDLE:
Well, thank you Ron. Well, there still seems to be no sign of Picasso, so I'll hand you back to the studio.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, we've just heard that Picasso is approaching the Tolworth roundabout on the A3 so come in Sam Trench at Tolworth.

DIRECTION:
Cut to Sam Trench at roadside.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well something certainly is happening here at Tolworth roundabout, David. I can now see Picasso, he's cycling down very hard towards the roundabout, he's about 75-50 yards away and I can now see his painting... it's an abstract... I can see some blue some purple and some little black oval shapes... I think I can see...

DIRECTION:
A Pepperpot comes up and nudges him.

MICHAEL PALIN:
That's not Picasso - that's Kandinsky.

DIRECTION:
excited

DIRECTION:
cylists pass in front of him

JOHN CLEESE:
Piet Mondrian - just behind, Piet Mondrian the Neo-Plasticist, and then a gap, then the main bunch, here they come, Chagall, Max Ernst, Miro, Dufy, Ben Nicholson, Jackson Pollock and Bernard Buffet making a break on the outside here, Brancusi's going with him, so is Gericault, Ferdinand Leger, Delaunay, De Kooning, Kokoschka's dropping back here by the look of it, and so's Paul Klee dropping back a bit and, right at the back of this group, our very own Kurt Schwitters..

MICHAEL PALIN:
He's German!

JOHN CLEESE:
But as yet absolutely no sign of Pablo Picasso, and so from Tolworth roundabout back to the studio.

DIRECTION:
Toulouse-Lautrec pedals past on a child's tricycle.

DIRECTION:
Cut back to studio.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well I think I can help you there Sam, we're getting reports in from the AA that Picasso, Picasso has fallen off...he's fallen off his bicycle on the B2127 just outside Ewhurst, trying to get a short cut through to Dorking via Gomslake and Peashall. Well, Picasso is reported to be unhurt, but the pig has a slight headache. And on that note we must say goodnight to you. Picasso has failed in his first bid for international cycling fame. So from all of us here at the 'It's the Arts' studio, it's goodnight. Goodnight.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Porker, eh? Swine.
