Mix through to Biggles and secretary in an office.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Miss Bladder, take a letter.

NICKI HOWORTH:
Yes, Señor Biggles.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Don't call me señor! I'm not a Spanish person. You must call me Mr Biggles, or Group Captain Biggles or Mary Biggles if I'm dressed as my wife, but never señor.

DIRECTION:
Sorry.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I've never even been to Spain.

DIRECTION:
You went to Ibiza last year.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
That's still not grounds for calling me señor, or Don Beeg-les for that matter. Right, Dear King Haakon...

DIRECTION:
Of Norway, is that?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Just put down what I say.

DIRECTION:
Do I put that down?

Of course you don't put that down.

DIRECTION:
Dear King Haakon, I am not dictating what?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no, no, you loopy brothel inmate.

DIRECTION:
I've had enough of this. I am not a courtesan.

DIRECTION:
moves round to front of the desk, sits on it and crosses her legs provocatively

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, oh, 'courtesan', oh aren't we grand. Harlot's not good enough for us eh? Paramour, concubine, fille de joie. That's what we are not. Well listen to me my fine fellow, you are a bit of tail, that's what you are.

DIRECTION:
I am not, you demented fictional character.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Algy says you are. He says you're no better than you should be.

DIRECTION:
And how would

DIRECTION:
he

DIRECTION:
know?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
And just what do you mean by that? Are you calling my old fictional comrade-in-arms a fairy?

DIRECTION:
Fairy! Poof's not good enough for Algy, is it? He's got to be a bleedin' fairy. Mincing old RAF queen.

DIRECTION:
sits at the desk

DIRECTION:
into the intercom

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Algy, I have to see you.

MICHAEL PALIN:

Hello, sweetie.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:

The door opens, Ginger enters as a terrible poof in camp flying gear, sequins, eye make-up, silver stars on his cheeks.

TERRY GILLIAM:
Yes, Biggles?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Are you a poof

DIRECTION:

TERRY GILLIAM:

Pantomime Princess Margaret enters from cupboard.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:

DIRECTION:
Quick cut to a loony.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Lemon curry?

DIRECTION:
Cut back to Biggles.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
