JOHN CLEESE:
The Adventures of Biggles. Part one - Biggles dictates a letter.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Miss Bladder, take a letter.

NICKI HOWORTH:
Yes, Se単or Biggles.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Don't call me se単or! I'm not a Spanish person. You must call me Mr Biggles, or Group Captain Biggles or Mary Biggles if I'm dressed as my wife, but never se単or.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I've never even been to Spain.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
That's still not grounds for calling me se単or, or Don Beeg-les for that matter. Right, Dear King Haakon...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Just put down what I say.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Of course you don't put that down.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Look.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
dictating.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Read that back.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no, no, you loopy brothel inmate.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, oh, 'courtesan', oh aren't we grand. Harlot's not good enough for us eh? Paramour, concubine, fille de joie. That's what we are not. Well listen to me my fine fellow, you are a bit of tail, that's what you are.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Algy says you are. He says you're no better than you should be.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
And just what do you mean by that? Are you calling my old fictional comrade-in-arms a fairy?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Algy, I have to see you.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right ho.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What ho everyone.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Are you gay?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I should bally well say so, old fruit.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ugh!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Rhyming slang - ginger beer.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ginger.

TERRY GILLIAM:
Hello, sweetie.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I have to see you.

TERRY GILLIAM:
Yes, Biggles?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Are you a poof

TERRY GILLIAM:
I should say not.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Thank God for that. Good lad.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Dear Princess Margaret.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Get back in the cupboard you pantomimetic royal person.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Lemon curry?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Dear real Princess Margaret, thank you for the eels, full stop. They were absolutely delicious and unmistakably regal, full stop. Sorry to mench but if you've finished with the hairdryer could you pop it in the post? Yours fictionally Biggles, Oh, PS see you at the Saxe-Coburgs' canasta evening.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
That should puzzle her.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Silence, naughty lady of the night!

JOHN CLEESE:
Next week part two - 'Biggles Flies Undone'.

JOHN CLEESE:
Meanwhile not very far away.
