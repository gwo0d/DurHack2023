MICHAEL PALIN:
Hello, good evening, and welcome to yet another edition of 'Interesting People'. And my first interesting person tonight is the highly interesting Mr Howard Stools from Kendal in Westmorland.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good evening Mr Stools.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Mr Stools, what makes you particularly interesting?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well that's

MICHAEL PALIN:
interesting, thank you for coming along on the show tonight Mr Stools.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Our next guest tonight has come all the way from Egypt, he's just flown into London today, he's Mr Ali Bayan, he's with us in the studio tonight and he's stark raving mad.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Mr Ali Bayan, stark raving mad. Now it's time for our music spot and we turn the spotlight tonight on the Rachel Toovey Bicycle Choir,

MICHAEL PALIN:
with their fantastic arrangement of 'Men of Harlech' for bicycle bells only.

MICHAEL PALIN:
The Rachel Toovey Bicycle Choir. Really interesting. Remember, if you're interesting and want to appear on this programme, write your name and address and your telephone number and send it to this address:

MICHAEL PALIN:
Thank you, thank you. Now here's an interesting person. Apart from being a full-time stapling machine, he can also give a cat influenza.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, you can't get much more interesting than that, or can you? With me now is Mr Thomas Walters of West Hartlepool who is totally invisible. Good evening, Mr Walters.

ERIC IDLE:
Over here, Hughie.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Mr Walters, are you sure you're invisible?

ERIC IDLE:
Oh yes, most certainly.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, Mr Walters, what's it like being invisible?

ERIC IDLE:
Well, for a start, at the office where I work I can be sitting at my desk all day and the others totally ignore me. At home, even though we are in the same room, my wife does not speak to me for hours, people pass me by in the street without a glance in my direction, and I can walk into a room without...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, whilst we've got interesting people, we met Mr Oliver Cavendish who...

ERIC IDLE:
... Even now you yourself, you do hardly notice me...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Mr Oliver Cavendish of Leicester, who claims to be able to recite the entire Bible in one second, whilst being struck on the head with a large axe. Ha, ha, wow. We've since discovered that he was a fraud, yes a fraud, he did not in fact recite the entire Bible he merely recited the first two words, 'In the...' before his death.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Now it's time for 'Interesting Sport', and this week it's all-in cricket, live from the Municipal Baths, Croydon.

MICHAEL PALIN:
With me now is Mr Ken Dove, twice voted the most interesting man in Dorking. Ken, I believe you're interested in shouting.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, I'm interested in shouting all right, by jove you certainly hit the nail on the head with that particular observation of yours then.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What does your wife think of this?

JOHN CLEESE:
Shut up!

ERIC IDLE:
... At parties for instance people never come up to me, I just sit there and everybody totally...

MICHAEL PALIN:
That is Tiddles, I believe?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, this is, this is Tiddles.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, and what does she do?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
She flies across the studio and lands in a bucket of water.

MICHAEL PALIN:
By herself?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, I fling her.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well that's extremely interesting, Ladies and gentlemen - Mr Don Savage and Tiddles.

JOHN CLEESE:
I'm more interesting than a wet pussycat.

ERIC IDLE:
... for hour after hour...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, great, well now for the first lime on television 'Interesting People' brings you a man who claims he can send bricks to sleep by hypnosis. Mr Keith Maniac from Guatemala.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Good evening.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Keith, you claim you can send bricks to sleep.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, that is correct, I can...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Entirely by hypnosis.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes ... I use no artificial means, whatsoever.

JOHN CLEESE:
You've injured Mr Stools!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I simply stare at the brick and it goes to sleep.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, we have a brick here, Keith.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Perhaps you can send it to sleep for us...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh ... Ah, well, I am afraid that is already asleep.

MICHAEL PALIN:
How do you know?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, it's not moving ....

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, I see - have we got a moving brick? Yes, we've got a moving brick, Keith, it's coming over now.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
There we are, fast asleep.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Very good, very good indeed.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
All done with the eyes.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, Mr Keith Maniac from Guatemala.

JOHN CLEESE:
Mr Stools - speak to me, Howard.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Mr Keith Maniac of Guatemala... and now four tired undertakers.

ERIC IDLE:
We interrupt this very quickly to take you back to the Jimmy Buzzard interview, where we understand something exciting's just happened.

JOHN CLEESE:
I've fallen off my chair, Brian.
