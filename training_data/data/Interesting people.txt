MICHAEL PALIN:
Hello, good evening, and welcome to yet another edition of 'Interesting People'. And my first interesting person tonight is the highly interesting Mr Howard Stools from Kendal in Westmorland.

DIRECTION:
He puts a matchbox on desk in front of him. He presses a button on the desk and we hear applause. Releases button; applause stops abruptly. He opens the box a little and speaks into it.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good evening Mr Stools.

DIRECTION:
from inside box

DIRECTION:
Hello, David.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Mr Stools, what makes you particularly interesting?

DIRECTION:
Well, I'm only half an inch long.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well that's

DIRECTION:
extremely

MICHAEL PALIN:
interesting, thank you for coming along on the show tonight Mr Stools.

DIRECTION:
I thought you'd think that was interesting David, in fact...

DIRECTION:
shuts matchbox; applause

DIRECTION:
applause

MICHAEL PALIN:
Our next guest tonight has come all the way from Egypt, he's just flown into London today, he's Mr Ali Bayan, he's with us in the studio tonight and he's stark raving mad.

DIRECTION:
Applause. Cut to Ali Bayan who looks at camera in a very mad way. Applause.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Mr Ali Bayan, stark raving mad. Now it's time for our music spot and we turn the spotlight tonight on the Rachel Toovey Bicycle Choir,

MICHAEL PALIN:
with their fantastic arrangement of 'Men of Harlech' for bicycle bells only.

DIRECTION:
Cut to six men in oilskins and sou'westers. They sing 'Men of Harlech ', and at the end of each line mournfully ring bells. Applause at end.

MICHAEL PALIN:
The Rachel Toovey Bicycle Choir. Really interesting. Remember, if you're interesting and want to appear on this programme, write your name and address and your telephone number and send it to this address:

DIRECTION:
reads caption

MICHAEL PALIN:
Thank you, thank you. Now here's an interesting person. Apart from being a full-time stapling machine, he can also give a cat influenza.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a smart dressed man who coughs into a cat basket. We hear a meow and a feline sneeze. Cut back to compère.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, you can't get much more interesting than that, or can you? With me now is Mr Thomas Walters of West Hartlepool who is totally invisible. Good evening, Mr Walters.

DIRECTION:
turns to empty chair

DIRECTION:
off-screen

ERIC IDLE:
Over here, Hughie.

DIRECTION:
Compère turns to find a boringly dressed man sitting by him.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Mr Walters, are you sure you're invisible?

ERIC IDLE:
Oh yes, most certainly.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, Mr Walters, what's it like being invisible?

DIRECTION:
slowly and boringly

ERIC IDLE:
Well, for a start, at the office where I work I can be sitting at my desk all day and the others totally ignore me. At home, even though we are in the same room, my wife does not speak to me for hours, people pass me by in the street without a glance in my direction, and I can walk into a room without...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, whilst we've got interesting people, we met Mr Oliver Cavendish who...

DIRECTION:
droning on

ERIC IDLE:
... Even now you yourself, you do hardly notice me...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Mr Oliver Cavendish of Leicester, who claims to be able to recite the entire Bible in one second, whilst being struck on the head with a large axe. Ha, ha, wow. We've since discovered that he was a fraud, yes a fraud, he did not in fact recite the entire Bible he merely recited the first two words, 'In the...' before his death.

DIRECTION:
Cut to film montage of sporting clips.

DIRECTION:
voice over

MICHAEL PALIN:
Now it's time for 'Interesting Sport', and this week it's all-in cricket, live from the Municipal Baths, Croydon.

DIRECTION:
Boxing ring; two fully kitted out cricketers, who as the bell goes, approach each other and start hitting each other with cricket bats. Applause.

MICHAEL PALIN:
With me now is Mr Ken Dove, twice voted the most interesting man in Dorking. Ken, I believe you're interested in shouting.

DIRECTION:
shouting

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, I'm interested in shouting all right, by jove you certainly hit the nail on the head with that particular observation of yours then.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What does your wife think of this?

DIRECTION:
voice off, full-blooded

DIRECTION:
I agree with him.

JOHN CLEESE:
Shut up!

ERIC IDLE:
... At parties for instance people never come up to me, I just sit there and everybody totally...

DIRECTION:
Man holding cat enters.

MICHAEL PALIN:
That is Tiddles, I believe?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, this is, this is Tiddles.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, and what does she do?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
She flies across the studio and lands in a bucket of water.

MICHAEL PALIN:
By herself?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, I fling her.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well that's extremely interesting, Ladies and gentlemen - Mr Don Savage and Tiddles.

DIRECTION:
Man whirls the cat round and round. He lets go of the cat, it flies across studio. A hollow splash and a meow. Quick shot of a real cat sitting in a bucket.

JOHN CLEESE:
I'm more interesting than a wet pussycat.

ERIC IDLE:
... for hour after hour...

DIRECTION:
we see only his empty chair

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, great, well now for the first lime on television 'Interesting People' brings you a man who claims he can send bricks to sleep by hypnosis. Mr Keith Maniac from Guatemala.

DIRECTION:
Maniac is sitting by compère. He wears a top hat and an opera cloak.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Good evening.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Keith, you claim you can send bricks to sleep.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, that is correct, I can...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Entirely by hypnosis.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes ... I use no artificial means, whatsoever.

DIRECTION:
leans and picks matchbox off desk to light pipe, opens it and strikes match

DIRECTION:
from matchbox

DIRECTION:
Aaagh!

JOHN CLEESE:
You've injured Mr Stools!

DIRECTION:
picks up other box and lights pipe

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I simply stare at the brick and it goes to sleep.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, we have a brick here, Keith.

DIRECTION:
indicates brick on desk

MICHAEL PALIN:
Perhaps you can send it to sleep for us...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh ... Ah, well, I am afraid that is already asleep.

MICHAEL PALIN:
How do you know?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, it's not moving ....

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, I see - have we got a moving brick? Yes, we've got a moving brick, Keith, it's coming over now.

DIRECTION:
We see a man in a white coat preparing to throw brick. He throws it gently. It lands on the desk in front of Keith. Keith stares at it as it falls.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
There we are, fast asleep.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Very good, very good indeed.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
All done with the eyes.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, Mr Keith Maniac from Guatemala.

DIRECTION:
distressed - to matchbox

JOHN CLEESE:
Mr Stools - speak to me, Howard.

DIRECTION:
Quick cut back to all-in cricket.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Mr Keith Maniac of Guatemala... and now four tired undertakers.

DIRECTION:
Cut to film of four undertakers struggling up a hill carrying a coffin. One staggers and drops. The others lower the coffin, pick him up, and place him inside. Raising the coffin again they stagger off up the hill. Another undertaker collapses; the remaining two place him in the coffin. Exhaustedly they pick up the coffin, but have only gone two or three paces when one of them collapses. The remaining one drags him into the coffin, pushing him in with some difficulty, and forces the lid shut. He debates with himself for a moment on how to pick up the coffin, then disgustedly throws away his hat and climbs into the coffin, shutting the lid behind him. The coffin moves off by itself.

ERIC IDLE:
We interrupt this very quickly to take you back to the Jimmy Buzzard interview, where we understand something exciting's just happened.

DIRECTION:
Cut back to the interview studio; Jimmy Buzzard is sitting on the floor.

JOHN CLEESE:
I've fallen off my chair, Brian.
