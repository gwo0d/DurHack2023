MICHAEL PALIN:
August 18th. Fell off near Bovey Tracey. The pump caught in my trouser leg.

MICHAEL PALIN:
The pump caught in my trouser leg, and my sandwiches were badly crushed.

ERIC IDLE:
35p please.

MICHAEL PALIN:
These sandwiches, however, were an excellent substitute.

JOHN CLEESE:
Give us ten woods, Barney.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hello!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah! I have only a fifty. Do you have change?

ERIC IDLE:
Well I'll have a look, but I may have to go to the bank.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'm most awfully sorry.

ERIC IDLE:
15p.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, what a stroke of luck. Well, all the very best.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And thank you again for the excellent banana and cheese delicacy.

MICHAEL PALIN:
August 23rd. Fell off near Budleigh Salterton.

MICHAEL PALIN:
...and the pump caught in my trouser leg...

MICHAEL PALIN:
That shouldn't really happen to a self-sealing container, should it? What do you keep your hard-boiled eggs in?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I think in future I shall lash them to the handlebars with adhesive tape...this should obviate a recurrence of the same problem...well I can't stop here all day...I'm on a cycling tour of North Cornwall. Must be off.

MICHAEL PALIN:
August 26th. Fell off near Ottery St Mary. The pump caught in my trouser leg. Decided to wear short trousers from now on.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Fell off near Tiverton. Perhaps a shorter pump is the answer.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Excuse me, madam, I wonder if you could tell me of a good bicycle shop in this village, where I could find either a means of adapting my present pump, or failing that, purchase a replacement?

ERIC IDLE:
There's only one shop here.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What a stroke of luck. Now perhaps cycling will become less precarious.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes? (a nurse puts her head round the door)

CAROL CLEVELAND:
A Mr Pither to see you, doctor. His bicycle pump got caught in his sock.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, thank you nurse, show him in please.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
This way, please.

ERIC IDLE:
Morning.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, a very good morning to you too, Doctor

ERIC IDLE:
Ah, I understand you had an accident?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, my pump got...

ERIC IDLE:
...caught in your sock.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Absolutely. Yes. My fruit cake was damaged on one side.

ERIC IDLE:
Well...

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's got grit all over it.

ERIC IDLE:
Well now, are you in pain?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, heavens no.

ERIC IDLE:
Ah well, where were you hurt?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, fortunately, I escaped without injury.

ERIC IDLE:
Well what is the trouble?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Please, could you tell me the way to Iddesleigh?

ERIC IDLE:
I'm a doctor, you know.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh yes, absolutely. Normally I would have asked a policeman or a minister of the Church, but finding no one available, I thought it better to consult a man with some professional qualifications, rather than rely on the possibly confused testimony of a passer-by.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh alright.

ERIC IDLE:
Take this to a chemist.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Thank you.

MICHAEL PALIN:
September 2nd. Did not fall off outside Iddesley.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Fell off in Tavistock.

MICHAEL PALIN:
My foot caught in my trouser leg and that's how the bottle broke.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Tell her today, you could ring her.

JOHN CLEESE:
I can't. I can't.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I said you'd never guess.

JOHN CLEESE:
Sixteen years we've been together. I can't just ring her up.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Well, if you can't do it now, you never will.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Do you like Tizer?

JOHN CLEESE:
What? No. No.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Do you want me or not, James? It's your decision.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I suppose it is still available in this area, is it?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Do you want me or not, James?

JOHN CLEESE:
What?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Tizer.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Yes or no.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Is it still available in this area?

JOHN CLEESE:
I don't know.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
I see, in that case it's goodbye for ever, James.

JOHN CLEESE:
No! I mean yes!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh it is, is it?

JOHN CLEESE:
No.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh! You never could make up your mind.

JOHN CLEESE:
I can.... I have....

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Goodbye James.

JOHN CLEESE:
No wait, Lucille!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Does your lovely daughter like Tizer? Eh?

JOHN CLEESE:
Lucille!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Wouldn't mind buying her a bottle of Tizer.... if it's available in this area, that is.

JOHN CLEESE:
Would you like me to show you the door?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, that's extremely kind of you, but I saw it on the way in.

JOHN CLEESE:
You stupid, interfering little rat.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh! The very words of the garage mechanic in Bude!

MICHAEL PALIN:
I had just fallen off my bicycle, this is most kind of you, and my lemon curd tartlet had...

JOHN CLEESE:
Damn your lemon curd tartlet!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Just had a chat with your dad.
