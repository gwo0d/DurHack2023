DIRECTION:
The green lush Devon countryside. Theme music. The camera is tracking along a hedgerow beside the road. We see a head whizzing along, sometimes just above the hedgerow and sometimes bobbing out of sight, accasionally for long periods.

DIRECTION:
SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'THE CYCLING TOUR'

DIRECTION:
Mr. Pither, the cyclist, bobs up and down a few more times, then disappears from sight. There is a crash and clang of a bicycle in collision, mixed with the scream of a frightened hen, and stifled shout of alarm. We are still in long shot and see nothing. The music stops abruptly on the crash.

DIRECTION:
voice over

MICHAEL PALIN:
August 18th. Fell off near Bovey Tracey. The pump caught in my trouser leg.

DIRECTION:
Cut to interior of a transport cafe. A rather surly proprietor with fag in mouth is operating an Espresso coffee machine. Pither, a fussy bespectacled little man, in sweater, trousers, is leaning over the counter, talking chattily.

MICHAEL PALIN:
The pump caught in my trouser leg, and my sandwiches were badly crushed.

ERIC IDLE:
35p please.

DIRECTION:
He goes back to working the machine.

MICHAEL PALIN:
These sandwiches, however, were an excellent substitute.

DIRECTION:
Enormous lorry driver comes up to counter.

JOHN CLEESE:
Give us ten woods, Barney.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hello!

DIRECTION:
the lorry driver looks at him without interest

DIRECTION:
the driver goes off with his cigarettes

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah! I have only a fifty. Do you have change?

DIRECTION:
with heavy sarcasm

ERIC IDLE:
Well I'll have a look, but I may have to go to the bank.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'm most awfully sorry.

DIRECTION:
handing him change

ERIC IDLE:
15p.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, what a stroke of luck. Well, all the very best.

DIRECTION:
Pither proffers his hand, the proprietor ignores it

MICHAEL PALIN:
And thank you again for the excellent banana and cheese delicacy.

DIRECTION:
He exits busily. The proprietor looks after him. Cut to hedgerows. Theme music. Pither's head bobbing up and down. At the same point in the music it disappears and there is a crash mingled with grunting of pig.

MICHAEL PALIN:
August 23rd. Fell off near Budleigh Salterton.

DIRECTION:
A brief shot of an unindentifiable animated Gilliam monster looking over the top of a hedge. Cut to a woman gardening. Behind her we see Pither's head peering over the hedge.

MICHAEL PALIN:
...and the pump caught in my trouser leg...

DIRECTION:
she carries on digging trying to ignore him

DIRECTION:
no reaction

DIRECTION:
she goes on digging

DIRECTION:
again no reaction

MICHAEL PALIN:
That shouldn't really happen to a self-sealing container, should it? What do you keep your hard-boiled eggs in?

DIRECTION:
The lady gardener goes back into house. Pither waits for a few moments.

DIRECTION:
shouting

MICHAEL PALIN:
I think in future I shall lash them to the handlebars with adhesive tape...this should obviate a recurrence of the same problem...well I can't stop here all day...I'm on a cycling tour of North Cornwall. Must be off.

DIRECTION:
Cut to hedgerows again. Pither's head bowling along. Theme music. He dips out of sight. Crash and a cow moos.

MICHAEL PALIN:
August 26th. Fell off near Ottery St Mary. The pump caught in my trouser leg. Decided to wear short trousers from now on.

DIRECTION:
Another brief shot of the animated monster peeking over a hedgerow. Cut to another hedgerow. Pither's head bowling along. Short burst of music. Crash.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Fell off near Tiverton. Perhaps a shorter pump is the answer.

DIRECTION:
Another monster peeps briefly. Cut to a tiny village high street, deserted save for an old lady. Pither cycles into shot. He is in shorts, but still has his bicycle clips on. He approaches the old lady.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Excuse me, madam, I wonder if you could tell me of a good bicycle shop in this village, where I could find either a means of adapting my present pump, or failing that, purchase a replacement?

ERIC IDLE:
There's only one shop here.

DIRECTION:
She points with a shaking finger. Camera pans very slightly to one side to reveal a shop with a huge four-foot-high sign: 'Bicycle Pump Centre - Specialists In Shorter Bicycle Pumps'. Another sign: 'Short Pumps Available Here'. Another sign: 'We Shorten Pumps While-U-Wait'. The camera shows the shop only for a couple of seconds and pans back to the old lady and Pither.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What a stroke of luck. Now perhaps cycling will become less precarious.

DIRECTION:
Cut to interior of doctor's surgery. There is a knock on the door.

DIRECTION:
.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes? (a nurse puts her head round the door)

CAROL CLEVELAND:
A Mr Pither to see you, doctor. His bicycle pump got caught in his sock.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, thank you nurse, show him in please.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
This way, please.

DIRECTION:
The nurse exits, Pither enters in shorts and sweater.

ERIC IDLE:
Morning.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, a very good morning to you too, Doctor

ERIC IDLE:
Ah, I understand you had an accident?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, my pump got...

ERIC IDLE:
...caught in your sock.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Absolutely. Yes. My fruit cake was damaged on one side.

ERIC IDLE:
Well...

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's got grit all over it.

ERIC IDLE:
Well now, are you in pain?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, heavens no.

ERIC IDLE:
Ah well, where were you hurt?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, fortunately, I escaped without injury.

ERIC IDLE:
Well what is the trouble?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Please, could you tell me the way to Iddesleigh?

ERIC IDLE:
I'm a doctor, you know.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh yes, absolutely. Normally I would have asked a policeman or a minister of the Church, but finding no one available, I thought it better to consult a man with some professional qualifications, rather than rely on the possibly confused testimony of a passer-by.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh alright.

DIRECTION:
he scribbles something on a piece of paper and hands it to Pither

ERIC IDLE:
Take this to a chemist.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Thank you.

DIRECTION:
Cut to exterior of a chemist's shop. A chemist comes out holding the paper and points up the street. Pither thanks him and mounts his bike. Cut to the hedgerows again. Pither's head. Theme music reaches the point where Pither normally falls off, his head disappears, the music cuts off. There is no crash. Suddenly Pither's head reappears further on and the music starts up again.

MICHAEL PALIN:
September 2nd. Did not fall off outside Iddesley.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a small market town. A line of cars. Pither's head just above roofs of cars. Theme music. He suddenly disappears, the music stops and there is a crash.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Fell off in Tavistock.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a discreet corner of a Watney's pub. Soft music. A middle-aged businessman and a sexy secretary who obviously want to be alone are sitting huddled over a table. At the next table is Pither, with half-pint in front of him.

MICHAEL PALIN:
My foot caught in my trouser leg and that's how the bottle broke.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Tell her today, you could ring her.

JOHN CLEESE:
I can't. I can't.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I said you'd never guess.

JOHN CLEESE:
Sixteen years we've been together. I can't just ring her up.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Well, if you can't do it now, you never will.

DIRECTION:
tapping the man on the leg

MICHAEL PALIN:
Do you like Tizer?

DIRECTION:
to Pither

JOHN CLEESE:
What? No. No.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Do you want me or not, James? It's your decision.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I suppose it is still available in this area, is it?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Do you want me or not, James?

JOHN CLEESE:
What?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Tizer.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Yes or no.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Is it still available in this area?

JOHN CLEESE:
I don't know.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
I see, in that case it's goodbye for ever, James.

JOHN CLEESE:
No! I mean yes!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh it is, is it?

JOHN CLEESE:
No.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh! You never could make up your mind.

JOHN CLEESE:
I can.... I have....

DIRECTION:
taking off ring

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Goodbye James.

DIRECTION:
She runs out sobbing.

JOHN CLEESE:
No wait, Lucille!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Does your lovely daughter like Tizer? Eh?

JOHN CLEESE:
Lucille!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Wouldn't mind buying her a bottle of Tizer.... if it's available in this area, that is.

DIRECTION:
turning on Pither

JOHN CLEESE:
Would you like me to show you the door?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, that's extremely kind of you, but I saw it on the way in.

JOHN CLEESE:
You stupid, interfering little rat.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh! The very words of the garage mechanic in Bude!

DIRECTION:
The man picks Pither up by the scruff of the neck and the seat of his pants. He carries him bodily towards the door.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I had just fallen off my bicycle, this is most kind of you, and my lemon curd tartlet had...

JOHN CLEESE:
Damn your lemon curd tartlet!

DIRECTION:
Pither is thrown out. He picks himself up and sees girl outside sobbing.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Just had a chat with your dad.

DIRECTION:
Girl bursts into further tears. Whistling cheerfully, Pither gets on his bicycle and, happier than he has been for a long time, he cycles off down the road and round a corner. Sounds of car-tyre screech and crash of Pither going straight into a car. Cut to interior of car speeding along highway. Pither is sitting in the back seat with his bicycle. The driver, Mr Gulliver, talks with a professional precision.
