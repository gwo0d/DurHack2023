A shot rings out. He dies. Cut to Dennis Moore on a horse blowing smoke from gun and putting it in his holster. He gallops off. We see him swooping down, after a couple of riding shots, on another stagecoach.

DIRECTION:
Cut to the inside of a bus. A judge is sitting there in full robes, looking rather unhappy. He is obviously one of the competitors from earlier. His friend tries to cheer him up.

TERRY JONES:
I thought you should have won. I mean, judicially you swept the board ... all right, he has posture, but where was he in the summing up?

DIRECTION:
Behind these two another judge is sitting with his mother, crying.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh shut up Melford, there's always next year.

DIRECTION:
Another judge further back petulantly rips up his number card. We cut to the outside back of this bus. The destination board says 'The End'. As the bus drives away we hold on a board sticking out from a building which reads 'Hospital... sorry no cheques'.
