DIRECTION:
Music comes in underneath: 'When Does a Dream Begin'. Mix to a young airman on an airfield gazing into a WAAF's eyes. Black and white, soft focus and scratched film to look like a not very good print of a 40's film. Airman sings.

NEIL INNES:
When does a dream begin?

NEIL INNES:
Does it start with a goodnight kiss?

NEIL INNES:
Is it conceived or simply achieved

NEIL INNES:
Is it born in a moment of bliss?

NEIL INNES:
Or is it begun when two hearts are one

NEIL INNES:
When does a dream exist?

NEIL INNES:
The vision of you appears somehow

NEIL INNES:
Impossible to resist

NEIL INNES:
But I'm not imagining seeing you

NEIL INNES:
For who could have dreamed of this?

NEIL INNES:
When reality is dismissed?

NEIL INNES:
Or does it commence when we lose all pretence
