DIRECTION:
As he talks we zoom out quickly from the set to reveal it is not a monitor in the studio but a TV set in a G-plan type sitting room. A housewife (Mrs Pinnet) sits watching, wearing an apron and a scarf and with her hair in curlers. The doorbell sounds. She switches the TV off and answers the door which opens straight into the living room. There in the street stands a truly, amazing figure of fun. A man in a bowler hat with an axe sticking out of it, big red joke nose, illuminated bow tie that revolves, joke broad shoulders, clown's check jacket, long johns with sock suspenders, heavy army boots and leading a goat with a hat. Close-up.

DIRECTION:
Hello. Mrs Rogers?

TERRY JONES:
No. Ooh I must be in the wrong house,

DIRECTION:
She shuts the door on him and we follow her as she crosses the room. She climbs out of the window. Back yard of terraced house. She scrambles over a quite high dividing wall into next door and starts to scramble into next-door window.

DIRECTION:
Interior of a more cluttered working-dass sitting-room. There is a TV in there with Sir Vincent still camping it up.

JOHN CLEESE:
So from now on we're going to do things my way. For a start David Hockney is going to design the bombs. And I've seen the plans...

DIRECTION:
The doorbell rings.

TERRY JONES:
That must be the new gas cooker.

DIRECTION:
She switches the TV off. Immediate thunderous epic music.

DIRECTION:
SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION:

DIRECTION:
in stone lettering, as for Ben Hur

DIRECTION:
Both caption and music switch off suddenly as she opens the door. Outside the door are two gas men with a new cooker.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Morning. Mrs G. Crump?

TERRY JONES:
No - Mrs G. Pinnet.

MICHAEL PALIN:
This is 46 Egernon Crescent?

TERRY JONES:
No - Road. Egernon Road.

DIRECTION:
looks at a bit of paper

MICHAEL PALIN:
Road, yes, says here. Yeah. Right, could I speak to Mrs G. Crump please?

TERRY JONES:
Oh there's nobody here of that name. It's Mrs G. Pinnet. 46 Egernon Road.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well it says 'Crump' here. Don't it, Harry?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yeah - it's on the invoice.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yeah, definitely Crump.

TERRY JONES:
Well there must have been a mistake, because the address is right, and that's definitely the cooker I ordered - a blue and white CookEasi.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well you can't have this. This is Crump.

TERRY JONES:
Oh dear, what are we going to do?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well I don't know. What we can do for you is take it back to the Depot, get a transfer slip from Crump to Pinnet, and put it on a special delivery.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yeah - that's best. We'll special it for you, we'll get it down there today and you'll get it back in ten weeks.

TERRY JONES:
Ten weeks! Blimey, can't you just leave this one?

MICHAEL PALIN:
What this? What leave it here?

DIRECTION:
they seem thunderstruck

TERRY JONES:
Yes.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well I dunno. I suppose we could.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, but she'd have to fill out a temporary despatch note.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yeah we could leave it on a temporary despatch note.

TERRY JONES:
Well that's sorted out then. What a mess, isn't it.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I know, it's ridiculous really, but there you are. Glad we could be of such a help. Right, would you sign it down there please, Mrs Crump?

TERRY JONES:
Pinnet.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Pinnet. Listen, just for the books make it a bit easier, could you sign it Crump-Pinnet.

TERRY JONES:
Right.

DIRECTION:
she signs

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right. Thank you very much, dear. The cooker's yours. Right. Thank you very much, dear. Right.

DIRECTION:
they push it just inside the door and move off

MICHAEL PALIN:
Sorry about the bother... but there you are ... you know ... cheerio!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Cheerio, Mrs Crump!

TERRY JONES:
Heh, excuse me! Cooey! Er, can you put it in the kitchen?

DIRECTION:
coming back

MICHAEL PALIN:
You what?

TERRY JONES:
Well I can't cook on it unless it's connected up.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh we didn't realize you had an installation invoice.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
An MI.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, we can't touch it without an MI, you see.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Or an R16.

DIRECTION:
who is suddenly revealed behind the two of them

JOHN CLEESE:
If it's a special.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Nah - it's not special ... the special's back at the Depot.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, the special's the same as installation invoice.

JOHN CLEESE:
So it's an R16.

TERRY JONES:
What's an installation invoice?

MICHAEL PALIN:
A pink form from Reading.

TERRY JONES:
Oh - we wondered what that was. Now these are the forms.

DIRECTION:
she produces a large wad of papers, sorts through and products a pink form which she hands to them

MICHAEL PALIN:
That's the one, love. Yeah, this should be all I need. Hang on. This is for Pinnet. Mrs G. Pinnet.

TERRY JONES:
That's right. I'm Mrs G. Pinnet.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well we've got Crump-Pinnet on the invoice.

TERRY JONES:
Well shall I sign it Crump-Pinnet then?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, no, no - not an MI - no.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No - that's from Area Service at Reading.

DIRECTION:
suddenly revealed

ERIC IDLE:
No, Cheltenham isn't it?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, not this side of the street.

TERRY JONES:
Look I just want it connected up.

DIRECTION:
Much doubtfulness.

JOHN CLEESE:
What about London Office?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well they haven't got the machinery.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Not now.

DIRECTION:
suddenly, revealed

TERRY GILLIAM:
What! The Hounslow Depot?

ERIC IDLE:
No - they're still on standard pressure.

DIRECTION:
suddenly revealed

DIRECTION:
Same with Twickenham.

TERRY JONES:
But surely they can connect up a gas cooker?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh yeah, we could connect it up, love, but not unless it's an emergency.

TERRY JONES:
But this

DIRECTION:
is

TERRY JONES:
an emergency.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No it's not. An emergency is 290... 'where there is actual or apparent loss of combustible gaseous substances'.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yeah, it's like a leak.

DIRECTION:
Seventh gas man is revealed.

DIRECTION:
Yeah, or a 478.

JOHN CLEESE:
No - that's valve adjustment.

TERRY JONES:
But there can't be a leak unless you've connected it up.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, quite. We'd have to turn it on.

TERRY JONES:
Well can't you turn it on

DIRECTION:
and

TERRY JONES:
connect it up?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No. But what we can do, and this is between you and me, I shouldn't really be telling you this, we'll turn your gas on, make a hole in your pipe, you ring Hounslow emergency, they'll be around here in a couple of days.

TERRY JONES:
What, a house full of gas! I'll be dead by then

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh well, in that case you'd have the South East Area Manager round here like a shot.

TERRY JONES:
Really?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah yes. 'One or more persons overcome by fumes', you'd have Head Office, Holbom, round here.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes. That's murder you see.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Or suicide.

TERRY GILLIAM:
No. That's S42.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh.

DIRECTION:
Eighth gas man is revealed.

DIRECTION:
Still? I thought it was Hainault.

TERRY GILLIAM:
No - Central area and Southall Marketing Division, they're both on the S42 now.

TERRY JONES:
And they'd be able to connect it up?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh - they'd do the lot for you, love.

TERRY JONES:
And they'd come round this afternoon?

MICHAEL PALIN:
... Well what is it now... 11:30... murder... they'll be round here by two.

TERRY JONES:
Oh well that's wonderful.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh well, right love, if you'd like to lie down here.

TERRY JONES:
All right.

DIRECTION:
she does so

MICHAEL PALIN:
Okay Harry.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Okay. Gas on.

DIRECTION:
holding a gas pipe to her mouth

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right, deep breaths love. Ring Head Office would you Norman...

ERIC IDLE:
Shall I go through maintenance?

TERRY GILLIAM:
No, you'd better go through Deptford maintenance.

DIRECTION:
Peckham's on a 207 .... .

DIRECTION:
... that's LeWisham. What about Tottenham? No that would be a 5.4.. what about Lewisham? It's central isn't it? Or Ruislip...
