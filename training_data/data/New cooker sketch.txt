TERRY JONES:
No. Ooh I must be in the wrong house,

JOHN CLEESE:
So from now on we're going to do things my way. For a start David Hockney is going to design the bombs. And I've seen the plans...

TERRY JONES:
That must be the new gas cooker.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Morning. Mrs G. Crump?

TERRY JONES:
No - Mrs G. Pinnet.

MICHAEL PALIN:
This is 46 Egernon Crescent?

TERRY JONES:
No - Road. Egernon Road.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Road, yes, says here. Yeah. Right, could I speak to Mrs G. Crump please?

TERRY JONES:
Oh there's nobody here of that name. It's Mrs G. Pinnet. 46 Egernon Road.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well it says 'Crump' here. Don't it, Harry?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yeah - it's on the invoice.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yeah, definitely Crump.

TERRY JONES:
Well there must have been a mistake, because the address is right, and that's definitely the cooker I ordered - a blue and white CookEasi.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well you can't have this. This is Crump.

TERRY JONES:
Oh dear, what are we going to do?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well I don't know. What we can do for you is take it back to the Depot, get a transfer slip from Crump to Pinnet, and put it on a special delivery.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yeah - that's best. We'll special it for you, we'll get it down there today and you'll get it back in ten weeks.

TERRY JONES:
Ten weeks! Blimey, can't you just leave this one?

MICHAEL PALIN:
What this? What leave it here?

TERRY JONES:
Yes.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well I dunno. I suppose we could.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, but she'd have to fill out a temporary despatch note.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yeah we could leave it on a temporary despatch note.

TERRY JONES:
Well that's sorted out then. What a mess, isn't it.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I know, it's ridiculous really, but there you are. Glad we could be of such a help. Right, would you sign it down there please, Mrs Crump?

TERRY JONES:
Pinnet.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Pinnet. Listen, just for the books make it a bit easier, could you sign it Crump-Pinnet.

TERRY JONES:
Right.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right. Thank you very much, dear. The cooker's yours. Right. Thank you very much, dear. Right.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Sorry about the bother... but there you are ... you know ... cheerio!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Cheerio, Mrs Crump!

TERRY JONES:
Heh, excuse me! Cooey! Er, can you put it in the kitchen?

MICHAEL PALIN:
You what?

TERRY JONES:
Well I can't cook on it unless it's connected up.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh we didn't realize you had an installation invoice.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
An MI.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, we can't touch it without an MI, you see.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Or an R16.

JOHN CLEESE:
If it's a special.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Nah - it's not special ... the special's back at the Depot.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, the special's the same as installation invoice.

JOHN CLEESE:
So it's an R16.

TERRY JONES:
What's an installation invoice?

MICHAEL PALIN:
A pink form from Reading.

TERRY JONES:
Oh - we wondered what that was. Now these are the forms.

MICHAEL PALIN:
That's the one, love. Yeah, this should be all I need. Hang on. This is for Pinnet. Mrs G. Pinnet.

TERRY JONES:
That's right. I'm Mrs G. Pinnet.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well we've got Crump-Pinnet on the invoice.

TERRY JONES:
Well shall I sign it Crump-Pinnet then?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, no, no - not an MI - no.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No - that's from Area Service at Reading.

ERIC IDLE:
No, Cheltenham isn't it?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, not this side of the street.

TERRY JONES:
Look I just want it connected up.

JOHN CLEESE:
What about London Office?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well they haven't got the machinery.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Not now.

TERRY GILLIAM:
What! The Hounslow Depot?

ERIC IDLE:
No - they're still on standard pressure.

TERRY JONES:
But surely they can connect up a gas cooker?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh yeah, we could connect it up, love, but not unless it's an emergency.

TERRY JONES:
But this

TERRY JONES:
an emergency.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No it's not. An emergency is 290... 'where there is actual or apparent loss of combustible gaseous substances'.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yeah, it's like a leak.

JOHN CLEESE:
No - that's valve adjustment.

TERRY JONES:
But there can't be a leak unless you've connected it up.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, quite. We'd have to turn it on.

TERRY JONES:
Well can't you turn it on

TERRY JONES:
connect it up?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No. But what we can do, and this is between you and me, I shouldn't really be telling you this, we'll turn your gas on, make a hole in your pipe, you ring Hounslow emergency, they'll be around here in a couple of days.

TERRY JONES:
What, a house full of gas! I'll be dead by then

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh well, in that case you'd have the South East Area Manager round here like a shot.

TERRY JONES:
Really?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah yes. 'One or more persons overcome by fumes', you'd have Head Office, Holbom, round here.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes. That's murder you see.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Or suicide.

TERRY GILLIAM:
No. That's S42.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh.

TERRY GILLIAM:
No - Central area and Southall Marketing Division, they're both on the S42 now.

TERRY JONES:
And they'd be able to connect it up?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh - they'd do the lot for you, love.

TERRY JONES:
And they'd come round this afternoon?

MICHAEL PALIN:
... Well what is it now... 11:30... murder... they'll be round here by two.

TERRY JONES:
Oh well that's wonderful.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh well, right love, if you'd like to lie down here.

TERRY JONES:
All right.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Okay Harry.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Okay. Gas on.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right, deep breaths love. Ring Head Office would you Norman...

ERIC IDLE:
Shall I go through maintenance?

TERRY GILLIAM:
No, you'd better go through Deptford maintenance.
