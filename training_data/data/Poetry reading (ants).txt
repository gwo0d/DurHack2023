DIRECTION:
Cut to a poetry reading. Wordsworth, Shelley, Keats and Tennyson are present. Chris stands quietly in the comer hoping not to be noticed.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, it's so nice to see such a large turnout this afternoon. And I'd like to start off by welcoming our guest speakers for this afternoon, Mr Wadsworth...

TERRY JONES:
Wordsworth!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Sorry, Wordsworth... Mr John Koots, and Percy Bysshe.

TERRY GILLIAM:
Shelley!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Just a little one, medium dry,

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
and Alfred Lorde.

DIRECTION:
Tennyson.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Tennis ball.

DIRECTION:
Son, son.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Sorry - Alfred Lord, who is evidently Lord Tennisball's son. And to start off I'm going to ask Mr Wadsworth to recite his latest offering, a little pram entitled 'I wandered lonely as a crab' and it's all about ants.

DIRECTION:
Murmur of exalted anticipation. Wordsworth rises rather gloomily.

TERRY JONES:
I wandered lonely as a

DIRECTION:
cloud

DIRECTION:
That floats on high over vales and hills

DIRECTION:
When all at once I saw a crowd

DIRECTION:
A host of golden worker ants.

DIRECTION:
Ripples of applause.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Thank you, thank you, Mr Bradlaugh. Now, Mr Bysshe.

TERRY GILLIAM:
Shelley.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh...

DIRECTION:
the dwarf refills her glass

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
... is going to read one of his latest psalms, entitled 'Ode to a crab'.

DIRECTION:
rising: and taking his place quietly

DIRECTION:
I met a traveller in an antique land

DIRECTION:
Who said 'Six vast and trunkless legs of stone

DIRECTION:
Stand in the desert

DIRECTION:
And on the pedestal these words appear

DIRECTION:
My name is Ozymandias, King of Ants

DIRECTION:
oohs from his audience

DIRECTION:
Look on my feelers, termites, and despair

DIRECTION:
I am the biggest ant you'll ever see

DIRECTION:
The ants of old weren't half as bold and big

DIRECTION:
And fierce as me'.

DIRECTION:
Enormous applause.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Thank you Mr Amontillado. I'd like to ask one or two of you at the back not to soil the carpet, there is a restroom upstairs if you find the poems too exciting

DIRECTION:

she falls off the podium

ERIC IDLE:
My heart aches and a drowsy numbness pains

DIRECTION:
My senses, as though an anteater I'd seen

DIRECTION:
panic spreads and the audience half rise

DIRECTION:
A nasty long-nosed brute

DIRECTION:
screams from the audience

DIRECTION:
With furry legs and sticky darting tongue

DIRECTION:
I seem to feel its cruel jaws

DIRECTION:
Crunch crunch there go my legs

DIRECTION:
Snap snap my thorax too

DIRECTION:
various screaming women faint

DIRECTION:
My head's in a twain, there goes my brain

DIRECTION:
Swallow, swallow, swallow, slurp

DIRECTION:
he loses control

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Mr Keats, Mr Keats, please leave immediately.

ERIC IDLE:
It's true. Don't you see. It's true. It happens.

DIRECTION:
she bustles him out

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ladies and gentlemen, I do apologize for that last... well I hesitate to call it a pram ... but I had no idea ... and talking of filth... I have asked you once about the carpet ... Now, I do appreciate that last poem was very frightening... but please! Now before we move on to tea and pramwiches, I would like to ask Arthur Lord Tenniscourt to give us his latest little plum entitled 'The Charge of the Ant Brigade'.

DIRECTION:
Half an inch, half an inch...

DIRECTION:
Enter Queen Victoria with a fanfare, followed by Albert's coffin.

DIRECTION:
The Queen, the Queen.

DIRECTION:
they all bow and scrape

MICHAEL PALIN:
My loyal subjects, we are here today on a matter of national import. My late husband and we are increasingly disturbed by recent developments in literary style

DIRECTION:

MICHAEL PALIN:

DIRECTION:
Theme.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Theme ... of modern poetry here in Germany. We are not ... amusiert?

DIRECTION:
an attendant whispers

MICHAEL PALIN:
Entertained. From now on, ants is verboten. Instead it's skylarks, daffodils, nightingales, light brigades and ... was ist das schreckliche Gepong ... es schmecke wie ein Scheisshaus... und so weiter. Well, we must away now or we shall be late for the races. God bless you alles.

DIRECTION:
Chris leaves. We cut to him outside a door with a sign saying 'Electric Kettles'.

TERRY JONES:
Psst! Electric kettles over here, Sir.
