DIRECTION:
Gulliver enters the scene; his head is still bandaged

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh hello!

TERRY JONES:
We cannot stay here. We must leave immediately. There is a ship in Marseilles.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I did enjoy your song for Europe, Clodagh.

TERRY JONES:
I have seen an agent in the town. My life is in danger.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Danger, Clodagh?

TERRY JONES:
Stalin has always hated me.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No one hates you, Clodagh.

TERRY JONES:
I will not let myself fall into the hands of these scum.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I think you should go and have a little lie down, my dear. There is a busy day tomorrow of concerts and promotional tours.

TERRY JONES:
I. One of the founders of the greatest nation on earth. I! Whom Lenin has called his greatest friend.

DIRECTION:
From the darkness we hear French voices.

JOHN CLEESE:
Taisez-vous. Taisez-vous.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh dear.

TERRY JONES:
I! Who have worked all my life that my people should live.

DIRECTION:
A pair of middle class French people in pyjamas appear.

JOHN CLEESE:
Taisez-vous. Qu'est-ce que le bruit? C'est impossible!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Er... my name is Pither.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh... you are English?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Er yes, that's right. I'm on a cycling tour of North Cornwall, taking in Bude...

TERRY JONES:
I will not be defeated. I will return to my country to fight against this new tyranny!

MICHAEL PALIN:
This is Clodagh Rogers, the Irish-born girl singer.

ERIC IDLE:
Mais oui - c'est Clodagh Rogers - 'Jack-in-a-box'!

DIRECTION:
sings

DIRECTION:
calls

ERIC IDLE:
Genevieve! Gerard! C'est Clodagh Rogers la fameuse chanteuse Anglaise.

DIRECTION:
Two teenagers in pyjamas and carrying autograph books appear and rush towards Gulliver.

TERRY JONES:
I will never surrender! I will never surrender!...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Excusez-moi Madame Clodagh. Ecrivez-vous votre nom dans mon livre des hommes célèbrites, s'il vous plait. Là, au-dessous de Denis Compton.

DIRECTION:
Gulliver signs and hands the book back.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Maman! Ce n'est pas la belle Clodagh.

ERIC IDLE:
Quoi?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
C'est Trotsky le révolutionaire.

JOHN CLEESE:
Trotsky!

ERIC IDLE:
Mais Trotsky ne chante pas.

JOHN CLEESE:
Il chante un peu.

ERIC IDLE:
Mais pas professionalement. Qu'il pense de Lenin.

JOHN CLEESE:
Ah! Lenin!! Quel chanteur: 'If I ruled the world'.

DIRECTION:
A brief film clip of Lenin, apparently singing the next line of the song.

TERRY JONES:
Lenin. My friend. I come.

DIRECTION:
He dashes off into the forest possessed.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh excuse her, she's not very well recently, pressure of work, laryngitis, you know...

DIRECTION:
He gets on his bike and pedals off hurriedly after Gulliver into the forest.

DIRECTION:
still reminiscing

JOHN CLEESE:
Et aussi Monsieur Kerensky avec le 'Little White Bull', eh?

ERIC IDLE:
Formidable.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a few quick shots of Gulliver dashing through the trees and then of Pither making much slower progress due to his bike. Cut to a shot of a French couple snogging in car.

TERRY JONES:
Lenin! I come! Lenin!

DIRECTION:
Je t'aime.

DIRECTION:
seeing Gulliver

DIRECTION:
Maurice! Regardez! C'est la chanteuse anglaise Clodagh Rogers.

DIRECTION:
Ah mais oui!

DIRECTION:
sings

DIRECTION:
he switches on car radio and the song is heard throughout the forest

DIRECTION:
Cut to Russian street. Pither cycles along with Gulliver looking like Trotsky on the back.
