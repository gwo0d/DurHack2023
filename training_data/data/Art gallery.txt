JOHN CLEESE:
'Allo, Marge!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh hello, Janet, how are you love?

JOHN CLEESE:
Fancy seeing you! How's little Ralph?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, don't ask me! He's been nothing but trouble all morning. Stop it Ralph!

DIRECTION:
she slaps at unseen infant

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Stop it!

JOHN CLEESE:
Same as my Kevin.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Really?

JOHN CLEESE:
Nothing but trouble ... leave it alone! He's just been in the Florentine Room and smeared tomato ketchup all over Raphael's Baby Jesus.

DIRECTION:
shouting off sharply

JOHN CLEESE:
Put that Baroque masterpiece down!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, we've just come from the Courtauld and Ralph smashed every exhibit but one in the Danish Contemporary Sculpture Exhibition.

JOHN CLEESE:
Just like my Kevin. Show him an exhibition of early eighteenth-century Dresden Pottery and he goes berserk. No, I said no, and I meant no!

DIRECTION:
smacks unseen infant again

JOHN CLEESE:
This morning we were viewing the early Flemish Masters of the Renaissance and Mannerist Schools, when he gets out his black aerosol and squirts Vermeer's Lady At A Window!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Still it's not as bad as spitting is it?

DIRECTION:
firmly

DIRECTION:
slaps the infant

JOHN CLEESE:
that if he spits at a painting I'll never take him to an exhibition again.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ralph used to spit - he could hit a Van Gogh at thirty yards. But he knows now it's wrong - don't you Ralph?

DIRECTION:
she looks down

DIRECTION:
she disappears from shot

DIRECTION:
smack; she comes back into shot holding a copy of Turner's Fighting Temeraire in a lovely gilt frame but all tattered

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, look at that! The Fighting Temeraire - ruined! What shall I do?

DIRECTION:
taking control

JOHN CLEESE:
Now don't do a thing with it love, just put it in the bin over there.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes take my word for it, Marge. Kevin's eaten most of the early nineteenth-century British landscape artists, and I've learned not to worry. As a matter of fact, I feel a bit peckish myself.

DIRECTION:
she breaks a bit off the Turner

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes...

DIRECTION:
Marge also tastes a bit.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I never used to like Turner.

DIRECTION:
swallowing

JOHN CLEESE:
No ... I don't know much about art, but I know what I like.
