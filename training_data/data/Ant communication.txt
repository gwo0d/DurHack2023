MICHAEL PALIN:
Hello and welcome to the University of the Air. And first this afternoon, part seventeen in our series of lectures on animal communications. This afternoon we look at recent discoveries in the field of intraspecific signalling codes in the family formicidea.

ERIC IDLE:
That's a stroke of luck, Marcus...

DIRECTION:
Cut to a restaurant. A waiter (Graham) stands at one side. Our hero (Terry J) enters, the waiter approaches him and they go through an elaborate signalling or greeting ceremony, stamping and so forth. The waiter does strange series of movements.

DIRECTION:
CAPTION: 'MAY I HAVE YOUR COAT'

DIRECTION:
Hero stamps a lot and clasps the waiters bottom.

DIRECTION:
CAPTION: 'I DON'T HAVE A COAT. I AM AN ANT'

DIRECTION:
Waiter routine.

DIRECTION:
CAPTION: 'AREN'T WE ALL?'

DIRECTION:
Hero routine.

DIRECTION:
CAPTION: 'WHERE'S BRUNO?'

DIRECTION:
CAPTION: 'WHAT'S THE SPECIAL TODAY?'

DIRECTION:
CAPTION: 'FILLET OF ANTEATER'

DIRECTION:
CAPTION: 'THAT'LL LEARN IT'

DIRECTION:
Mother enters. She is rather torn and tattered and her face is bloodstained.

TERRY JONES:
Turn that bloody thing off!

MICHAEL PALIN:
We interrupt this programme to bring you the latest news of the extraordinary Michael Ellis saga. Apparently Michael Ellis...

DIRECTION:
mother switches it off

ERIC IDLE:
Hey! I was watching that...

TERRY JONES:
Bloody thing. It's upsetting the tiger.

DIRECTION:
there is a roar and a crash of breaking crockery from the kitchen

TERRY JONES:
Oh Christ!

DIRECTION:
She dashes across to the door and goes into the kitchen. Chris quickly switches the TV on.

DIRECTION:
waits for noises to stop

MICHAEL PALIN:
... nd of the announcement. And now back to 'University of the Air', and our series for advanced medical students, 'Elements of Surgical Homeopathic Practice'. Part 68 - 'Ants'.

ERIC IDLE:
Ah! We're in luck again, Marcus.

DIRECTION:
A surgeon appears on television. He makes a few ant gestures.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hello formicidophiles! Before the blood and guts that you're waiting to see, let's have a look at the anatomy of the little ant.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a drawing of an ant.

TERRY JONES:
The body of the ant is divided into three sections.

DIRECTION:
arrow indicates

DIRECTION:
an animated hand with a knife slices bits off the ant

DIRECTION:
a hand pulls the legs off

TERRY JONES:
you're not so strong compared with me, four, five, six ... Ha!

ERIC IDLE:
I didn't know ants had

DIRECTION:
six

ERIC IDLE:
legs, Marcus!

TERRY JONES:
Well I can assure you they do, Mr Ellis.

ERIC IDLE:
Hey! You've got two legs missing! And that's a false feeler Marcus! Blimey!

DIRECTION:
He leaps up, switches the TV off and hurls it into the corner onto a pile of used TVs, and hurries out. The tiger is quiet now. Mother, bloody and torn, is emptying a tin of 'Kit-E-Cobra' into a box marked 'Cobra'.

ERIC IDLE:
I'm taking this ant back, mother - he's got two legs missing.

TERRY JONES:
Hey! Mrs McWong's been on the phone! The polar bear's been in her garden again.

ERIC IDLE:
Well I'll get it on the way back from the store.

TERRY JONES:
Well mind you do - his droppings are enormous.

DIRECTION:
Chris goes through the door, mother shouts after him

DIRECTION:
she tosses a wad out to him

DIRECTION:
Cut to the garden outside. There are TVs heaped in the garden path. Chris catches the wad of notes and leaves through the garden gate as a TV van is unloading half a dozen TVs onto a trolley, prior to wheeling them into the house.
