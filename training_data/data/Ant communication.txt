MICHAEL PALIN:
Hello and welcome to the University of the Air. And first this afternoon, part seventeen in our series of lectures on animal communications. This afternoon we look at recent discoveries in the field of intraspecific signalling codes in the family formicidea.

ERIC IDLE:
That's a stroke of luck, Marcus...

TERRY JONES:
Turn that bloody thing off!

MICHAEL PALIN:
We interrupt this programme to bring you the latest news of the extraordinary Michael Ellis saga. Apparently Michael Ellis...

ERIC IDLE:
Hey! I was watching that...

TERRY JONES:
Bloody thing. It's upsetting the tiger.

ERIC IDLE:
Ah! We're in luck again, Marcus.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hello formicidophiles! Before the blood and guts that you're waiting to see, let's have a look at the anatomy of the little ant.

TERRY JONES:
The body of the ant is divided into three sections.

TERRY JONES:
you're not so strong compared with me, four, five, six ... Ha!

ERIC IDLE:
I didn't know ants had

ERIC IDLE:
legs, Marcus!

TERRY JONES:
Well I can assure you they do, Mr Ellis.

ERIC IDLE:
Hey! You've got two legs missing! And that's a false feeler Marcus! Blimey!

ERIC IDLE:
I'm taking this ant back, mother - he's got two legs missing.

TERRY JONES:
Hey! Mrs McWong's been on the phone! The polar bear's been in her garden again.

ERIC IDLE:
Well I'll get it on the way back from the store.

TERRY JONES:
Well mind you do - his droppings are enormous.
