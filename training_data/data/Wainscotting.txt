GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Um, that's an interesting word, isn't it?

MICHAEL PALIN:
What?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Wainscotting ... Wainscotting ... Wainscotting ... sounds like a little Dorset village, doesn't it? Wainscotting.

DIRECTION:
Cut to the village of Wains Cotting. A woman rushes out of a house.

ERIC IDLE:
We've been mentioned on telly!

DIRECTION:
Cut back to Concretes' house.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Now, where is it worst?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, down here. You can usually hear them.

DIRECTION:
Indicates base of wall, which has a label on it saying 'Wainscotting'.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Sssssh

DIRECTION:
Baa ... baa ... baa ... baa ... baa ... baa...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, that's sheep you've got there.

DIRECTION:
Baa ... baa.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, that's definitely sheep. A bit of a puzzle, really.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Is it?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yeah, well, I mean it's (a) not going to respond to a nice piece of cheese and (b) it isn't going to fit into a trap.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh - what are you going to do?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, we'll have to look for the hole.

DIRECTION:
We follow them as they look along the wainscotting.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh yeah. There's one here.

DIRECTION:
She indicates a small black mousehole.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no, that's mice.

DIRECTION:
He reaches in and pulls out a line of mice strung out on a piece of elastic. Then he lets go so they shoot in again. The ratcatcher moves on. He moves a chair, behind which there is a three-foot-high black hole.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ah, this is what we're after.

DIRECTION:
The baa-ings get louder. At this point six cricketers enter the room.

JOHN CLEESE:
Excuse me, is the third test in here?

TERRY JONES:
No - that was a joke - a joke!

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh blimey,

DIRECTION:
exeunt

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Right. Well, I'm going in the wainscotting.

DIRECTION:
Cut to 'Wains Cotting' woman, who rushes out again.

ERIC IDLE:
They said it again.

DIRECTION:
Back to the sitting room.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'm going to lay down some sheep poison.

DIRECTION:
He disappears into the hole. We hear:

DIRECTION:
Baa, baa, baa.

DIRECTION:
A gunshot. The ratcatcher reappears clutching his arm.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Aagh. Ooh! It's got a gun!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Blimey.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Now, normally a sheep is a placid, timid creature, but you've got a killer.
