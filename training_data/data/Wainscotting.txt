MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, blimey. You'd think he was awake all the night, scrabbling down by the wainscotting.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Um, that's an interesting word, isn't it?

MICHAEL PALIN:
What?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Wainscotting ... Wainscotting ... Wainscotting ... sounds like a little Dorset village, doesn't it? Wainscotting.

ERIC IDLE:
We've been mentioned on telly!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Now, where is it worst?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, down here. You can usually hear them.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Sssssh

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, that's sheep you've got there.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, that's definitely sheep. A bit of a puzzle, really.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Is it?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yeah, well, I mean it's (a) not going to respond to a nice piece of cheese and (b) it isn't going to fit into a trap.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh - what are you going to do?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, we'll have to look for the hole.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh yeah. There's one here.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no, that's mice.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ah, this is what we're after.

JOHN CLEESE:
Excuse me, is the third test in here?

TERRY JONES:
No - that was a joke - a joke!

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh blimey,

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Right. Well, I'm going in the wainscotting.

ERIC IDLE:
They said it again.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'm going to lay down some sheep poison.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Aagh. Ooh! It's got a gun!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Blimey.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Now, normally a sheep is a placid, timid creature, but you've got a killer.
