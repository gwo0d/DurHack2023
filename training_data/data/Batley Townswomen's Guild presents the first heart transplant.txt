JOHN CLEESE:
That was last year's re-enactment of the Battle of Pearl Harbor performed by the Batley Townswomen's Guild. It was written, directed and produced by Mrs Rita Fairbanks.

ERIC IDLE:
Hello again.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And what are your ladies going to do for us this year?

ERIC IDLE:
Well, this year we decided to re-enact something with a more modern flavour. We had considered a version of Michael Stewart's speech on Nigeria and there were several votes on the Committee for a staging of Herr Willi Brandt's visit to East Germany, but we've settled instead for a dramatization of the first heart transplant. Incidentally my sister Madge will be playing the plucky little springbok pioneer Christian Barnard.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well off we go, then with the Barley Townswomen's Guild re-enactment of the first heart transplant.
