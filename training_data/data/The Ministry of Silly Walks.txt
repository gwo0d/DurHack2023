JOHN CLEESE:
'Times' please.

TERRY JONES:
Oh yes sir, here you are.

JOHN CLEESE:
Thank you.

TERRY JONES:
Cheers.

JOHN CLEESE:
Good morning. I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, but I'm afraid my walk has become rather sillier recently, and so it takes me rather longer to get to work.

JOHN CLEESE:
Now then, what was it again?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well sir, I have a silly walk and I'd like to obtain a Government grant to help me develop it.

JOHN CLEESE:
I see. May I see your silly walk?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, certainly, yes.

JOHN CLEESE:
That's it, is it?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, that's it, yes.

JOHN CLEESE:
It's not particularly silly, is it? I mean, the right leg isn't silly at all and the left leg merely does a forward aerial half turn every alternate step.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, but I think that with Government backing I could make it very silly.

JOHN CLEESE:
Coffee?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes please.

JOHN CLEESE:
Now Mrs Two-Lumps, would you bring us in two coffees please?

JOHN CLEESE:
... Out of her mind. Now the Japanese have a man who can bend his leg back over his head and back again with every single step. While the Israelis... ah, here's the coffee.

JOHN CLEESE:
Thank you - lovely.

JOHN CLEESE:
You're really interested in silly walks, aren't you?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh rather. Yes.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well take a look at this, then.

JOHN CLEESE:
Now Mr Pudey. I'm not going to mince words with you. I'm going to offer you a Research Fellowship on the Anglo-French silly walk.

MICHAEL PALIN:
La Marche Futile?

JOHN CLEESE:
Bonjour ... et maintenant ... comme d'habitude, au sujet du Le Marché Commun. Et maintenant, je vous presente, encore une fois, mon ami, le pouf célèbre, Jean-Brian Zatapathique.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Merci, mon petit chou-chou Brian Trubshawe. Et maintenant avec les pieds à droite, et les pieds au gauche, et maintenant l'Anglais-Française Marche Futile, et voilà
