GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Bloody repeats!

DIRECTION:
She presses the switch. The arab boy flinches with pain and turns and switches of the TV set.

TERRY JONES:
Yes, repeats or war films. It really makes you want to micturate.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
People on television treat the general public like idiots.

TERRY JONES:
Well we

DIRECTION:

TERRY JONES:

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh no we are

DIRECTION:
Cut to Mrs Elizabeth III coming out of the front door in a fairly well-to-do mock Tudor detached house in its own grounds. She runs headlong into a tree opposite the front door. Repeat a few times. Then she rushes into a field, digs a hole three feet deep and stands in it. Cut to her standing beside a letter box. She straps on a long false nose and pokes it through the letter box. She drinks a delicate cup of tea at a posh caf√© and eats the whole cup. Cut to her nailing something to a lorry. The lorry starts off to reveal that she had been nailing herself to the lorry. She is dragged away. Cut to TV planners at a window, watching Mrs Elizabeth III doing silly things in a car park below them. She has a cream bun hanging from a long stick which comes out of her hat. She walks along strangely.
