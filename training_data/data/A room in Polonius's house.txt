Hello, and welcome to 'A Room in Polonius's House'. Well tonight is European Cup night. One result is already in from Munich. The European Cup, first round, second leg, Bayern MÃ¼nchen 4397, Wrexham 1. So Wrexham going through there on aggregate. Well, now it's time for racing, so let's go straight over to Epsom and Brian McNutty.
