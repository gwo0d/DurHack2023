A Viking hut. A Viking comes out and has great difficulty mounting his horse.

TERRY JONES:

The Viking has still failed to mount his horse. Both he and the horse look a bit exasperated.

Well it wasn't all that terrible.

DIRECTION:
Cut back to the office.

JOHN CLEESE:
No, no, I meant terrible in the sense of unfortunate.

DIRECTION:
Cut to the Viking.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh.

JOHN CLEESE:
Anyway, our plea for assistance has been answered by the North Malden Icelandic Saga Society who've given us some very useful information about the saga and so we carry on now with 'Njorl's Saga' with our thanks going, once again, to the North Maiden Icelandic Saga Society.

ERIC IDLE:
the land where golden streams sang their way through fresh green meadows. Where there were halls and palaces, an excellent swimming pool and one of the most attractive bonus incentive schemes for industrial development in the city. Only fifteen miles from excellent Thames-side docking facilities and within easy reach of the proposed M25. Here it was that Erik Njorl, son of Frothgar, met the mayor. Mr Arthur Huddinut, a local solicitor.

DIRECTION:
Erik rides up to the town hall and is met by the mayor.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Welcome to North Malden.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, everyone is welcome to North Malden, none more so than the businessmen and investors who shape our society of the future. Here at North Malden...

DIRECTION:
His voice fades under the following.

ERIC IDLE:
And we apologize to viewers of 'Njorl's Saga' who may be confused by some of the references to North Malden. After a frank exchange of views we have agreed to carry on showing this version supplied to us by the North Malden Icelandic Saga Society on the undertaking that future scenes will adhere more closely to the spirit of twelfth-century Iceland.

DIRECTION:
Film leader countdown (5, 4, 3. . .) then shot of Erik riding away into bleak landscape.

ERIC IDLE:
With moist eyes, Erik leaves this happy land to return to the harsh uneconomic realities of life in the land of Ljosa waters. On his way Erik rested a while in the land of Bjornsstrand - the land of dark forces, where Gildor was King.

Erik comes to a river in a wood; he drinks

JOHN CLEESE:
Hello? Is that the North Malden Icelandic Society?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, that's right.

JOHN CLEESE:
About this saga.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh yes, the Icelandic saga.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good, isn't it.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well er, I don't know, but you promised us that you would stick to the spirit of the original text.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well I mean a lot of these things that are happening, well they just don't quite ring true.

DIRECTION:
One of the knights is carrying a sign: 'Malden, Gateway to Industry'.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, it's a new interpretation really.

DIRECTION:
Another carries a sign, 'ICI thanks Malden'.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well we don't want a new...

DIRECTION:
More signs: 'Invest in Malden', 'Malden - 45% Interest Free Loans '.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Banners were a very important part of Icelandic lore, Mr Mills.

JOHN CLEESE:
No, no, I'm sorry I, I can't accept that, it's gone too far, I'm very sorry but we'll have to terminate the agreement. You're just trying to cash in on the BBC's exciting Icelandic saga.

DIRECTION:
The knights are carrying more and more advertising banners and signs.

MICHAEL PALIN:
That's business, Mr Mills.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, that's as maybe but it's not the way the BBC works.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well I'm sorry you feel that way but er, you know, if you ever want to come to Malden...
