JOHN CLEESE:
This little-known Icelandic saga, written by an unknown hand in the late thirteenth century, has remained undiscovered until today. Now it comes to your screens for the first time. Fresh from the leaves of Iceland's history. The terrible 'Njorl's Saga'.

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's not that terrible.

JOHN CLEESE:
No, I meant terribly violent.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh yeah, yeah.

ERIC IDLE:
Erik Njorl, son of Frothgar, leaves his home to seek Hangar the Elder at the home of Thorvald Nlodvisson, the son of Gudleif, half brother of Thorgier, the priest of Ljosa water, who took to wife Thurunn, the mother of Thorkel Braggart, the slayer of Cudround the powerful, who knew Howal, son of Geernon, son of Erik from Valdalesc, son of Arval Gristlebeard, son of Harken, who killed Bjortguaard in Sochnadale in Norway over Cudreed, daughter of Thorkel Long, the son of Kettle-Trout, the half son of Harviyoun Half-troll, father of Ingbare the Brave, who with Isenbert of Gottenberg the daughter of Hangbard the Fierce ...

TERRY JONES:
I must apologize for an error in the saga. Evidently Thorgier, the Priest of Ljosa water who took to wife Thurunn, the mother of Thorkel Braggart, the slayer of Gudmund the powerful, who knew Howal, son of Geernon, son of Erik from Vadalesc ...

JOHN CLEESE:
Well I'm afraid we're having a little trouble getting this very exciting Icelandic saga started. If any of you at home have any ideas about how to get this exciting saga started again here's the address to write to:

MICHAEL PALIN:
Help the Exciting Icelandic Saga, 18b MacNorten Buildings, Oban.

JOHN CLEESE:
Hello, well I was the third voice you heard just now. I'm sorry about that terrible mess.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well it wasn't all that terrible.

JOHN CLEESE:
No, no, I meant terrible in the sense of unfortunate.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh.

JOHN CLEESE:
Anyway, our plea for assistance has been answered by the North Malden Icelandic Saga Society who've given us some very useful information about the saga and so we carry on now with 'Njorl's Saga' with our thanks going, once again, to the North Maiden Icelandic Saga Society.

ERIC IDLE:
Erik Njorl, son of Frothgar rode off into the desolate plain.

ERIC IDLE:
the land where golden streams sang their way through fresh green meadows. Where there were halls and palaces, an excellent swimming pool and one of the most attractive bonus incentive schemes for industrial development in the city. Only fifteen miles from excellent Thames-side docking facilities and within easy reach of the proposed M25. Here it was that Erik Njorl, son of Frothgar, met the mayor. Mr Arthur Huddinut, a local solicitor.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Welcome to North Malden.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, everyone is welcome to North Malden, none more so than the businessmen and investors who shape our society of the future. Here at North Malden...

ERIC IDLE:
And we apologize to viewers of 'Njorl's Saga' who may be confused by some of the references to North Malden. After a frank exchange of views we have agreed to carry on showing this version supplied to us by the North Malden Icelandic Saga Society on the undertaking that future scenes will adhere more closely to the spirit of twelfth-century Iceland.

ERIC IDLE:
With moist eyes, Erik leaves this happy land to return to the harsh uneconomic realities of life in the land of Ljosa waters. On his way Erik rested a while in the land of Bjornsstrand - the land of dark forces, where Gildor was King.

ERIC IDLE:
Proud warriors who bore on their chests the letters of their dread name.

JOHN CLEESE:
Hello? Is that the North Malden Icelandic Society?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, that's right.

JOHN CLEESE:
About this saga.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh yes, the Icelandic saga.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good, isn't it.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well er, I don't know, but you promised us that you would stick to the spirit of the original text.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well I mean a lot of these things that are happening, well they just don't quite ring true.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, it's a new interpretation really.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well we don't want a new...

JOHN CLEESE:
... I mean we wanted the proper thing... I mean just look what's happening now.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Banners were a very important part of Icelandic lore, Mr Mills.

JOHN CLEESE:
No, no, I'm sorry I, I can't accept that, it's gone too far, I'm very sorry but we'll have to terminate the agreement. You're just trying to cash in on the BBC's exciting Icelandic saga.

MICHAEL PALIN:
That's business, Mr Mills.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, that's as maybe but it's not the way the BBC works.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well I'm sorry you feel that way but er, you know, if you ever want to come to Malden...
