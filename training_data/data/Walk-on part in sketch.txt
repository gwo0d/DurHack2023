MICHAEL PALIN:
Ooh. Ooh.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, what is it dear?

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's from the BBC. They want to know if I want to be in a sketch on telly.

TERRY JONES:
Oooh. That's nice.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What? It's acting innit?

TERRY JONES:
Yes.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well I'm a plumber. I can't act.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, you never know till you try. Look at Mrs Brando's son next door. He was mending the fridge when they came and asked him to be the Wild One. What do they want you to do?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, they just want me to stand at a counter, and when the sketch starts I go out.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, that sounds nice. It's what they call a walk-on.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Walk-on? That's a walk-off, that's what this is.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, where is he, George?

JOHN CLEESE:
He bloody should have been.

TERRY JONES:
Well what else does it say?

MICHAEL PALIN:
It just says 'We would like you to be in a sketch. You are standing at a counter. When the sketch starts you go off. Yours faithfully, Lord Hill.'

TERRY JONES:
Oh well, you'd better be off then.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yeah, well, what about the cat?

TERRY JONES:
Oh I'll look after the cat. Goodness me, Mrs Newman's eldest never worried about the cat when he went off to do 'The Sweet Bird of Youth'.

MICHAEL PALIN:
All right then, all right. Bye. Bye dear.

TERRY JONES:
Bye bye, and mind you don't get seduced.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, it'll make a change from plumbing. Dad! Frank's got a television part.

TERRY JONES:
You missed him.
