If you don't tell me where the bomb is... if I don't give you the money... Unless you give me the bomb...

The money, thank you, pretty lady... the bomb will explode killing everybody.

JOHN CLEESE:
Including you.

ERIC IDLE:
I'll tell you where it is for a pound.

JOHN CLEESE:
Here's a pound.

I don't want Scottish money. They've got the numbers. It can be traced.
