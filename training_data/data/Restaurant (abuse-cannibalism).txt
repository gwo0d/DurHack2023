DIRECTION:
Short animation, then cut to restaurant vestibule. He and she are already there, entering. She is nattering. The waiter is waiting.

ERIC IDLE:
Ooh I don't like this, Ooh I don't like that. Oh I don't think much to all this. Oh fancy using that wallpaper. Fancy using mustard. Oo is that a proper one? Oo it's not real. Oh I don't think it's a proper restaurant unless they give you finger bowls. Oo I don't like him. I'm going to have a baby in a few years.

JOHN CLEESE:
Er, please excuse my wife. She may appear to be rather nasty but underneath she has a heart of formica.

DIRECTION:
the waiter grimaces

JOHN CLEESE:
I'm sorry about that.

TERRY JONES:
That's all right sir, we get all sorts of lines in here. The head waiter will be along to abuse you in a few moments, and now if you'll excuse me I have to go and commit suicide.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh I'm sorry.

TERRY JONES:
It's all right. It's not because of anything serious.

DIRECTION:
He exits. Shot off-screen and scream.

ERIC IDLE:
Quite frankly I'm against people who commit suicide, I don't like that sort of person at all. I'm plain people and I'm proud of it, my mother's the salt of the earth, and I don't take the pill 'cos it's nasty.

DIRECTION:
The head waiter comes in.

JOHN CLEESE:
Please excuse my wife, she may not be very beautiful, and she may have no money, and she may be a little talentless, boring and dull, but on the other hand ...

DIRECTION:
long pause

JOHN CLEESE:
... sorry I can't think of anything.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Fine. I'm the head waiter. This is a vegetarian restaurant only, we serve no animal flesh of any kind. We're not only proud of that, we're smug about it. So if you were to come in here asking me to rip open a small defenseless chicken, so you could chew its skin and eat its intestines, then I'm afraid I'd have to ask you to leave.

JOHN CLEESE:
No, no, no, no.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Likewise if you were to ask us to slice the sides of a cow and serve it with small pieces of its liver ...

DIRECTION:
small tic developing, getting carried away

DIRECTION:
reaction

MICHAEL PALIN:
Not for food anyway.

ERIC IDLE:
Quite frankly I'm against people who give vent to their loquacity by extraneous bombastic circumlocution.

DIRECTION:
they both look at her; pause

ERIC IDLE:
Oh I don't like that.

JOHN CLEESE:
Sometimes Shirley I think you're almost human.

DIRECTION:

MICHAEL PALIN:
Do you know I still wet my bed?

JOHN CLEESE:
Once I married someone who was beautiful, and young, and gay, and free. Whatever happened to her?

ERIC IDLE:
You divorced her and married me.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I met my second wife at a second-wife-swapping party. Trust me to arrive late.

DIRECTION:
Enter headmaster.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Always were late weren't you Thompson?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hello Headmaster. What are you doing here?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Fine, fine, fine, thank you. Fine, thank you. No more sherry for me don't you know. Warner House beat Badger House for the Second Cuppa, remarkable. We had to put most of the second form to sleep. No padre. Bad business. They were beginning to play with themselves. Still... You haven't seen my wife anywhere have you?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh thank God for that.

DIRECTION:
exits

ERIC IDLE:
Oh I don't like him. Do you know what I mean. Do you know what I mean. I mean do you know what I mean. Do you know what I mean. Do you know what I mean. I mean do you know what I mean. All men are the same.

DIRECTION:
Enter prologue, long white Greek robes, long white beard, holding a large staff.

DIRECTION:
Imagine not that these four walls contain the Mighty Owl of Thebes. For, gentles all, beauty sits most closely to them it can construe...

MICHAEL PALIN:
No it doesn't.

DIRECTION:
Sorry.

DIRECTION:
he exits

MICHAEL PALIN:
Fine. Would you care for a glass of blood? Oh what a giveaway.

ERIC IDLE:
No, we'd like to see the menu please. I don't think it's a proper restaurant unless you have a proper menu and anyway I might be pregnant.

JOHN CLEESE:
Perhaps you'd care for a drink?

ERIC IDLE:
Ever since you've married me, Douglas, you've treated me like an albatross.

DIRECTION:
A waiter enters pushing a large serving dish with a semi-naked Hopkins sitting unconcernedly in it.

TERRY JONES:
Evening.

JOHN CLEESE:
Good evening.

TERRY JONES:
I hope you're going to enjoy me this evening. I'm the special. Try me with some rice.

JOHN CLEESE:
I beg your pardon?

TERRY JONES:
A Hopkins au gratin a la chef.

JOHN CLEESE:
Ah, oh how do you...

DIRECTION:
makes to shake hands

DIRECTION:

TERRY JONES:
Don't play with your food.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, one word of warning, sir, a little tip.

DIRECTION:

DIRECTION:

TERRY JONES:
He's been here two weeks and nobody's touched him. 'Nuff said?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes thank you.

TERRY JONES:
Well I must get along or I'll spoil. Janet - to the kitchen.

DIRECTION:
There's a dead bishop in the lobby, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
I don't know who keeps bringing them in here.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh I don't like that. I think it's silly. It's not a proper sketch without a proper punchline. I mean I don't know much about anything, I'm stupid. I'm muggins. Nobody cares what I think. I'm always the one that has to do everything. Nobody cares about me. Well I'm going to have a lot of bloody babies and
