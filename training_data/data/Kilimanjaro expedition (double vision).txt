MICHAEL PALIN:
And now for something completely different. The office of Sir George Head, OBE.

DIRECTION:
Large study with maps and photographs on the wall and a large desk at which sits Sir George Head.

JOHN CLEESE:
Next please.

DIRECTION:
Arthur walks into the room and up to the desk.

DIRECTION:
looking up

JOHN CLEESE:
One at a time please.

ERIC IDLE:
There is only me, sir.

DIRECTION:
putting a hand over one eye

JOHN CLEESE:
So there is. Take a . . .

ERIC IDLE:
Seat?

JOHN CLEESE:
Seat! Take a seat. So!

DIRECTION:
looking over to Bob's right

DIRECTION:
keeps looking off to right

DIRECTION:
rather uncertain

ERIC IDLE:
Me, sir?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, I'd very much like to, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
Jolly good, jolly good.

DIRECTION:
he ticks the sheet and then looks straight at Bob

JOHN CLEESE:
And how about you?

DIRECTION:
putting hand over eye and looking both at Bob and to Bob's right

DIRECTION:
he tears up form

JOHN CLEESE:
Now let me fill you in. I'm leading this expedition and we're going to climb both peaks of Mount Kilimanjaro.

ERIC IDLE:
I thought there was only one peak, sir.

DIRECTION:
getting up, putting one hand over one eye again and going to large map of Africa on wall and peering at it at point-blank range

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, that'll save a bit of time. Well done. Now the object of this expedition is to see if we can find any traces of last year's expedition.

ERIC IDLE:
Last year's expedition?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, my brother was leading that, they were going to build a bridge between the two peaks,

DIRECTION:
looks at map with one hand over eye

JOHN CLEESE:
My idea I'm afraid. Now, I ought to tell you that I have practically everyone I need for this expedition ... so what special qualifications do you have?

ERIC IDLE:
Well, sir...

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, you first.

DIRECTION:
to Bob's right

DIRECTION:
to Bob

JOHN CLEESE:
Carry on.

ERIC IDLE:
Well I'm a fully qualified mountaineer.

JOHN CLEESE:
Mountaineer? Mountaineer

DIRECTION:
looks it up in the dictionary

JOHN CLEESE:
where the devil are they, mound, mount... mountain... a mountaineer: 'two men skilled in climbing mountains'. Jolly good, well you're in. Congratulations, both of you. Well, er, what are your names?

ERIC IDLE:
Arthur Wilson.

JOHN CLEESE:
Arthur Wilson, right well look, I'll call you

JOHN CLEESE:
Arthur Wilson two, just to avoid confusion.

ERIC IDLE:
Are you actually leading this expedition sir?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, we are leading this expedition to Africa.

ERIC IDLE:
And what routes will you both be taking?

JOHN CLEESE:
Good questions... shall I? Well we'll be leaving on January 22nd and taking the following routes.

DIRECTION:
goes over to large map, clearly labelled Surrey

JOHN CLEESE:
The A23s through Purleys down on the main roads near Purbrights avoiding Leatherheads and then taking the A231s entering Rottingdeans from the North. From Rottingdeans we go through Africa to Nairobis. We take the South road out of Nairobis for about twelve miles and then ask.

ERIC IDLE:
Does anyone speak Swahili, sir?

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, yes I think most of them do down there.

ERIC IDLE:
Does anyone in our party speak Swahili sir?

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, well Matron's got a smattering.

ERIC IDLE:
Apart from the two Matrons ...

JOHN CLEESE:
Good God, I'd forgotten about her.

ERIC IDLE:
Apart from them, who else is coming on the expedition, sir?

JOHN CLEESE:
Well we've got the Arthur Brown twins, two botanists called Machin, the William Johnston brothers ...

ERIC IDLE:
Two of them?

JOHN CLEESE:
No four of them, a pair of identical twins ... and a couple of the Ken Spinoza quads - the other two pulled out. And of course you two.

ERIC IDLE:
And none of these are mountaineers?

JOHN CLEESE:
Well you two are, and we've got a brace of guides called Jimmy Blenkinsop... because Kilimanjaro is a pretty tricky climb you know, most of it's up until you reach the very very top, and then it tends to slope away rather sharply. But Jimmy's put his heads together and worked out a way up.

DIRECTION:
opens door

DIRECTION:
Jimmy walks in wearing full climbing gear

JOHN CLEESE:
I don't believe you've met. Jimmy Blenkinsop - Arthur Wilson, Arthur Wilson -Jimmy Blenkinsop... Arthur Wilson two -James Blenkinsop one, James Blenkinsop one - Arthur Wilson two. Carry on Jimmies.

DIRECTION:
to Bob, reassuring him

DIRECTION:
puts hand over eye

DIRECTION:
Jimmy proceeds to walk round the room clambering over every single piece of available furniture. He doesn't stop talking. Causing a complete wreckage, he clambers over the desk, onto a bookcase and round the room knocking furniture over, meanwhile he is saying..

DIRECTION:
Now the approach to Kilimanjaro is quite simply over the foothills, and then we go on after that to ... ohh... to set a base camp, somewhere in the region of the bottom of the glacier when...

DIRECTION:
Jimmy staggers out headlong through the door. There are loud crashing noises

JOHN CLEESE:
He'll be leading the first assault.

ERIC IDLE:
Well I'm afraid I shan't be coming on your expedition sir, as I've absolutely no confidence in anyone involved in it.

DIRECTION:
Bob gets up and walks out slamming the door.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh dear.

DIRECTION:
pause - look over at other? Bob

JOHN CLEESE:
Well how about you?

DIRECTION:
sitting in chair at other angle of desk

ERIC IDLE:
Well I'm game, sir.

DIRECTION:
Cut back to two sirs, double image, split screen.

JOHN CLEESE:
So are we.

DIRECTION:
Cut to two announcers (Johns) at desks. They put telephones down, turns to camera, and announce:
