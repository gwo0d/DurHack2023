MICHAEL PALIN:
And now for something completely different. The office of Sir George Head, OBE.

JOHN CLEESE:
Next please.

JOHN CLEESE:
One at a time please.

ERIC IDLE:
There is only me, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
So there is. Take a . . .

ERIC IDLE:
Seat?

JOHN CLEESE:
Seat! Take a seat. So!

ERIC IDLE:
Me, sir?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, I'd very much like to, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
Jolly good, jolly good.

JOHN CLEESE:
And how about you?

JOHN CLEESE:
Now let me fill you in. I'm leading this expedition and we're going to climb both peaks of Mount Kilimanjaro.

ERIC IDLE:
I thought there was only one peak, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, that'll save a bit of time. Well done. Now the object of this expedition is to see if we can find any traces of last year's expedition.

ERIC IDLE:
Last year's expedition?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, my brother was leading that, they were going to build a bridge between the two peaks,

JOHN CLEESE:
My idea I'm afraid. Now, I ought to tell you that I have practically everyone I need for this expedition ... so what special qualifications do you have?

ERIC IDLE:
Well, sir...

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, you first.

JOHN CLEESE:
Carry on.

ERIC IDLE:
Well I'm a fully qualified mountaineer.

JOHN CLEESE:
Mountaineer? Mountaineer

JOHN CLEESE:
where the devil are they, mound, mount... mountain... a mountaineer: 'two men skilled in climbing mountains'. Jolly good, well you're in. Congratulations, both of you. Well, er, what are your names?

ERIC IDLE:
Arthur Wilson.

JOHN CLEESE:
Arthur Wilson, right well look, I'll call you

JOHN CLEESE:
Arthur Wilson two, just to avoid confusion.

ERIC IDLE:
Are you actually leading this expedition sir?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, we are leading this expedition to Africa.

ERIC IDLE:
And what routes will you both be taking?

JOHN CLEESE:
Good questions... shall I? Well we'll be leaving on January 22nd and taking the following routes.

JOHN CLEESE:
The A23s through Purleys down on the main roads near Purbrights avoiding Leatherheads and then taking the A231s entering Rottingdeans from the North. From Rottingdeans we go through Africa to Nairobis. We take the South road out of Nairobis for about twelve miles and then ask.

ERIC IDLE:
Does anyone speak Swahili, sir?

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, yes I think most of them do down there.

ERIC IDLE:
Does anyone in our party speak Swahili sir?

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, well Matron's got a smattering.

ERIC IDLE:
Apart from the two Matrons ...

JOHN CLEESE:
Good God, I'd forgotten about her.

ERIC IDLE:
Apart from them, who else is coming on the expedition, sir?

JOHN CLEESE:
Well we've got the Arthur Brown twins, two botanists called Machin, the William Johnston brothers ...

ERIC IDLE:
Two of them?

JOHN CLEESE:
No four of them, a pair of identical twins ... and a couple of the Ken Spinoza quads - the other two pulled out. And of course you two.

ERIC IDLE:
And none of these are mountaineers?

JOHN CLEESE:
Well you two are, and we've got a brace of guides called Jimmy Blenkinsop... because Kilimanjaro is a pretty tricky climb you know, most of it's up until you reach the very very top, and then it tends to slope away rather sharply. But Jimmy's put his heads together and worked out a way up.

JOHN CLEESE:
I don't believe you've met. Jimmy Blenkinsop - Arthur Wilson, Arthur Wilson -Jimmy Blenkinsop... Arthur Wilson two -James Blenkinsop one, James Blenkinsop one - Arthur Wilson two. Carry on Jimmies.

JOHN CLEESE:
He'll be leading the first assault.

ERIC IDLE:
Well I'm afraid I shan't be coming on your expedition sir, as I've absolutely no confidence in anyone involved in it.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh dear.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well how about you?

ERIC IDLE:
Well I'm game, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
So are we.
