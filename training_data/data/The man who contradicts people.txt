MICHAEL PALIN:
Good evening. I have with me in the studio tonight Mr Norman St. John Polevaulter, who for the last few years has been contradicting people...Mr Polevaulter, why do you contradict people?

TERRY JONES:
I don't!

MICHAEL PALIN:
You told me that you did.

TERRY JONES:
I most certainly did not!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh. I see. I'll start again.

TERRY JONES:
No you won't!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ssh! Mr Polevaulter I understand you don't contradict people.

TERRY JONES:
Yes I do!

MICHAEL PALIN:
And when

MICHAEL PALIN:
you start contradicting people?

TERRY JONES:
Well I did, in 1952.

MICHAEL PALIN:
1952?

TERRY JONES:
1947.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Twenty-three years ago.

TERRY JONES:
No!

JOHN CLEESE:
And so on and so on and so on. And now...

JOHN CLEESE:
Number seventeen. The top of the head.

JOHN CLEESE:
Number eighteen...the feather, rare.
