MICHAEL PALIN:
Good evening. I have with me in the studio tonight Mr Norman St. John Polevaulter, who for the last few years has been contradicting people...Mr Polevaulter, why do you contradict people?

TERRY JONES:
I don't!

MICHAEL PALIN:
You told me that you did.

TERRY JONES:
I most certainly did not!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh. I see. I'll start again.

TERRY JONES:
No you won't!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ssh! Mr Polevaulter I understand you don't contradict people.

TERRY JONES:
Yes I do!

MICHAEL PALIN:
And when

DIRECTION:
didn't

MICHAEL PALIN:
you start contradicting people?

TERRY JONES:
Well I did, in 1952.

MICHAEL PALIN:
1952?

TERRY JONES:
1947.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Twenty-three years ago.

TERRY JONES:
No!

DIRECTION:
Cut to announcer at desk in farmyard. He is fondly holding a small pig.

JOHN CLEESE:
And so on and so on and so on. And now...

DIRECTION:
Cut to picture of the Pope. Slight pause, so we think it might be something to do with the Pope. An arrow suddenly comes in above him pointing down at his head.

JOHN CLEESE:
Number seventeen. The top of the head.

DIRECTION:
Cut to picture of an indeterminate bit of flesh with a feather sticking out. Superimposed arrow pointing to feather.

JOHN CLEESE:
Number eighteen...the feather, rare.
