GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Hello, Mrs Premise.

JOHN CLEESE:
Hello, Mrs Conclusion.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Busy day?

JOHN CLEESE:
Busy! I've just spent four hours burying the cat.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Four hours to bury a cat?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes! It wouldn't keep still, wriggling about howling its head off.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh - it wasn't dead then?

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, no, no, but it's not at all a well cat so as we were going away for a fortnight's holiday, I thought I'd better bury it just to be on the safe side.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Quite right. You don't want to come back from Sorento to a dead cat. It'd be so anticlimactic. Yes, kill it now, that's what I say.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
We're going to have our budgie put down.

JOHN CLEESE:
Really? Is it very old?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No. We just don't like it. We're going to take it to the vet tomorrow.

JOHN CLEESE:
Tell me, how do they put budgies down then?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well it's funny you should ask that, but I've just been reading a great big book about how to put your budgie down, and apparently you can either hit them with the book, or, you can shoot them just there, just above the beak.

JOHN CLEESE:
Just there!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well well well. 'Course, Mrs Essence flushed hers down the loo.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ooh! No! You shouldn't do that - no that's dangerous. Yes, they breed in the sewers, and eventually you get evil-smelling flocks of huge soiled budgies flying out of people's lavatories infringing their personal freedom.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Good morning Mrs Cut-out.

JOHN CLEESE:
It's a funny thing freedom. I mean how can any of us be really free when we still have personal possessions.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You can't. You can't. I mean, how can I go off and join Frelimo when I've got nine more installments to pay on the fridge.

JOHN CLEESE:
No, you can't. You can't. Well this is the whole crux of Jean-Paul Sartre's 'Roads to Freedom'.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, it bloody isn't. The nub of that is, his characters stand for all of us in their desire to avoid action. Mind you, the man at the off-licence says it's an everyday story of French country folk.

JOHN CLEESE:
What does he know?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Nothing.

JOHN CLEESE:
Sixty new pence for a bottle of Maltese Claret. Well I personally think Jean-Paul's masterwork is an allegory of man's search for commitment.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No it isn't.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes it is.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Isn't.

JOHN CLEESE:
'Tis.

JOHN CLEESE:
All right. We can soon settle this. We'll ask him.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Do you know him?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, we met on holiday last year.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
In Ibeezer?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes. He was staying there with his wife and Mr and Mr Genet. Oh, I did get on well with Madam S. We were like that.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What was Jean-Paul like?

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, you know, a bit moody. Yes, he didn't join in the fun much. Just sat there thinking. Still, Mr Rotter caught him a few times with the whoopee cushion.

JOHN CLEESE:
Le Capitalisme et La Bourgeoisie ils sont la même chose... Oooh we did laugh.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, we'll give him a tinkle then.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, all right. She said they were in the book.

JOHN CLEESE:
Where's the Paris telephone directory?

ERIC IDLE:
It's on the drier.

JOHN CLEESE:
No, no, that's Budapest. Oh here we are Sartre ... Sartre.

TERRY JONES:
It's 621036.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, thank you, Mrs Varley.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well he's out distributing pamphlets to the masses but he'll be in at six.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh well, I'll ring BEA then.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh look, Paris!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
That's not Paris. Jean-Paul wouldn't live here. It's a right old dump.

ERIC IDLE:
But this is where they were wrong. For this was no old dump, but a town with a future, an urban El Dorado where the businessmen of today can enjoy the facilities of tomorrow in the comfort of yesterday. Provided by a go-getting, go-ahead council who know just how loud money can talk.

ERIC IDLE:
Interest rates are so low...

JOHN CLEESE:
Well it's none of my business but we had the same trouble with one of our Icelandic sagas. These people are terribly keen but they do rather tend to take over. I think I'd stick to Caribbean Islands if I were you.

JOHN CLEESE:
Fine... and now back to the saga.

JOHN CLEESE:
Here - this is not Paris, this is Iceland.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, well, Paris must be over there then.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, here we are, Number 25 ....

JOHN CLEESE:
Flat 1, Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Flat 2, Yves Montand, Flat 3, Jacques Cousteau, Flat 4, Jean Genet and Friend, Flat 5, Maurice Laroux...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Who's he?

JOHN CLEESE:
Never heard of him. Flat 6, Marcel Marceau, 'Walking Against the Wind' Ltd. Flat 7, Indira Gandhi?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
She gets about a bit, doesn't she?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, Flat 8, Jean-Paul and Betty-Muriel Sartre.

JOHN CLEESE:
C'est nous, Betty-Muriel, excusez que nous sorerues en retard.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oui, merci.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, rubbish.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Bonjour.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Parlez vous Anglais?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh yes. Good day.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hello, love!

JOHN CLEESE:
Hello! Oh this is Mrs Conclusion from No. 46.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Nice to meet you, dear.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Hello.

JOHN CLEESE:
How's the old man, then?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, don't ask. He's in one of his bleeding moods. 'The bourgeoisie this is the bourgeoisie that' - he's like a little child sometimes. I was only telling the Rainiers the other day - course he's always rude to them, only classy friends we've got - I was saying solidarity with the masses I said... pie in the sky! Oooh! You're not a Marxist are you Mrs Conclusion?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, I'm a Revisionist.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh good. I mean, look at this place! I'm at my wits end. Revolutionary leaflets everywhere. One of these days I'll revolutionary leaflets him. If it wasn't for the goat you couldn't get in here for propaganda.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh very well. Can we pop in and have a word with him?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes come along.

JOHN CLEESE:
Thank you.

MICHAEL PALIN:
But be careful. He's had a few. Mind you he's as good as gold in the morning, I've got to hand it to him, but come lunchtime it's a bottle of vin ordinaire - six glasses and he's ready to agitate.

JOHN CLEESE:
Coo-ee! Jean-Paul? Jean-Paul! It's only us. Oh pardon ... c'est même nous...

JOHN CLEESE:
Jean-Paul. Your famous trilogy 'Rues à Liberté, is it an allegory of man's search for commitment?

JOHN CLEESE:
I told you so.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh coitus.
