DIRECTION:
ends with an animated woman going into a laundromat. Cut to the interior of a laundromat. Various shabby folk sitting around. Mrs Conclusion approaches Mrs Premise and sits down.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Hello, Mrs Premise.

JOHN CLEESE:
Hello, Mrs Conclusion.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Busy day?

JOHN CLEESE:
Busy! I've just spent four hours burying the cat.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Four hours to bury a cat?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes! It wouldn't keep still, wriggling about howling its head off.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh - it wasn't dead then?

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, no, no, but it's not at all a well cat so as we were going away for a fortnight's holiday, I thought I'd better bury it just to be on the safe side.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Quite right. You don't want to come back from Sorento to a dead cat. It'd be so anticlimactic. Yes, kill it now, that's what I say.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
We're going to have our budgie put down.

JOHN CLEESE:
Really? Is it very old?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No. We just don't like it. We're going to take it to the vet tomorrow.

JOHN CLEESE:
Tell me, how do they put budgies down then?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well it's funny you should ask that, but I've just been reading a great big book about how to put your budgie down, and apparently you can either hit them with the book, or, you can shoot them just there, just above the beak.

JOHN CLEESE:
Just there!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well well well. 'Course, Mrs Essence flushed hers down the loo.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ooh! No! You shouldn't do that - no that's dangerous. Yes, they breed in the sewers, and eventually you get evil-smelling flocks of huge soiled budgies flying out of people's lavatories infringing their personal freedom.

DIRECTION:
life-size cut-out of woman at end of last animation goes by

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Good morning Mrs Cut-out.

JOHN CLEESE:
It's a funny thing freedom. I mean how can any of us be really free when we still have personal possessions.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You can't. You can't. I mean, how can I go off and join Frelimo when I've got nine more installments to pay on the fridge.

JOHN CLEESE:
No, you can't. You can't. Well this is the whole crux of Jean-Paul Sartre's 'Roads to Freedom'.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, it bloody isn't. The nub of that is, his characters stand for all of us in their desire to avoid action. Mind you, the man at the off-licence says it's an everyday story of French country folk.

JOHN CLEESE:
What does he know?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Nothing.

JOHN CLEESE:
Sixty new pence for a bottle of Maltese Claret. Well I personally think Jean-Paul's masterwork is an allegory of man's search for commitment.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No it isn't.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes it is.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Isn't.

JOHN CLEESE:
'Tis.

JOHN CLEESE:
All right. We can soon settle this. We'll ask him.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Do you know him?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, we met on holiday last year.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
In Ibeezer?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes. He was staying there with his wife and Mr and Mr Genet. Oh, I did get on well with Madam S. We were like that.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What was Jean-Paul like?

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, you know, a bit moody. Yes, he didn't join in the fun much. Just sat there thinking. Still, Mr Rotter caught him a few times with the whoopee cushion.

DIRECTION:
she demonstrates

JOHN CLEESE:
Le Capitalisme et La Bourgeoisie ils sont la même chose... Oooh we did laugh.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, we'll give him a tinkle then.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, all right. She said they were in the book.

DIRECTION:
shouts

JOHN CLEESE:
Where's the Paris telephone directory?

ERIC IDLE:
It's on the drier.

JOHN CLEESE:
No, no, that's Budapest. Oh here we are Sartre ... Sartre.

TERRY JONES:
It's 621036.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, thank you, Mrs Varley.

DIRECTION:
dials

DIRECTION:
as they wait they sing 'The Girl from Ipanema'

DIRECTION:
to Mrs Conclusion

DIRECTION:
to Madame Sartre

DIRECTION:
puts the phone down

JOHN CLEESE:
Well he's out distributing pamphlets to the masses but he'll be in at six.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh well, I'll ring BEA then.

DIRECTION:
Cut to them sitting on a raft in mid-ocean.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh look, Paris!

DIRECTION:
Cut to shot of a notice board on the seashore, it reads 'North Malden Welcomes Careful Coastal Craft'.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
That's not Paris. Jean-Paul wouldn't live here. It's a right old dump.

DIRECTION:
'Alan Whicker', complete with microphone, walks in front of sign.

ERIC IDLE:
But this is where they were wrong. For this was no old dump, but a town with a future, an urban El Dorado where the businessmen of today can enjoy the facilities of tomorrow in the comfort of yesterday. Provided by a go-getting, go-ahead council who know just how loud money can talk.

DIRECTION:
a phone off-screen starts to ring

ERIC IDLE:
Interest rates are so low...

DIRECTION:
Cut to head of drama's office; he is on the phone.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well it's none of my business but we had the same trouble with one of our Icelandic sagas. These people are terribly keen but they do rather tend to take over. I think I'd stick to Caribbean Islands if I were you.

DIRECTION:
rings off

JOHN CLEESE:
Fine... and now back to the saga.

DIRECTION:
CAPTION: 'NJORL'S SAGA - PART IV'

DIRECTION:
Thundering music. Cut to an Icelandic seashore. Dark and impressive. After a pause the pepperpots walk into shot.

JOHN CLEESE:
Here - this is not Paris, this is Iceland.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, well, Paris must be over there then.

DIRECTION:
points out to the sea; they walk back to the raft

DIRECTION:
Stock shot of Eiffel Tower. French accordion music. Mix through to French street thronged by old Frenchmen with berets and loaves. Mrs Conclusion and Mrs Premise appear and walk up to the front door of an apartment block. On the front door is a list of the inhabitants of the block. They read it out loud.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, here we are, Number 25 ....

DIRECTION:
reads

JOHN CLEESE:
Flat 1, Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Flat 2, Yves Montand, Flat 3, Jacques Cousteau, Flat 4, Jean Genet and Friend, Flat 5, Maurice Laroux...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Who's he?

JOHN CLEESE:
Never heard of him. Flat 6, Marcel Marceau, 'Walking Against the Wind' Ltd. Flat 7, Indira Gandhi?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
She gets about a bit, doesn't she?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, Flat 8, Jean-Paul and Betty-Muriel Sartre.

DIRECTION:
She rings the bell. A voice comes from the intercom.

DIRECTION:
Oui.

JOHN CLEESE:
C'est nous, Betty-Muriel, excusez que nous sorerues en retard.

DIRECTION:
Entrez.

DIRECTION:
Buzzer sounds.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oui, merci.

DIRECTION:
Interior the Sartres flat. It is littered with books and papers. We hear Jean-Paul coughing. Mrs Sartre goes to the door. She is a ratbag with a fag in her mouth and a duster over her head. A French song is heard on the radio. She switches it off.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, rubbish.

DIRECTION:
opens the door

MICHAEL PALIN:
Bonjour.

DIRECTION:
entering

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Parlez vous Anglais?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh yes. Good day.

DIRECTION:
Mrs Premise comes in

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hello, love!

JOHN CLEESE:
Hello! Oh this is Mrs Conclusion from No. 46.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Nice to meet you, dear.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Hello.

JOHN CLEESE:
How's the old man, then?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, don't ask. He's in one of his bleeding moods. 'The bourgeoisie this is the bourgeoisie that' - he's like a little child sometimes. I was only telling the Rainiers the other day - course he's always rude to them, only classy friends we've got - I was saying solidarity with the masses I said... pie in the sky! Oooh! You're not a Marxist are you Mrs Conclusion?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, I'm a Revisionist.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh good. I mean, look at this place! I'm at my wits end. Revolutionary leaflets everywhere. One of these days I'll revolutionary leaflets him. If it wasn't for the goat you couldn't get in here for propaganda.

DIRECTION:
Shot of a goat eating leaflets in corner of room.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh very well. Can we pop in and have a word with him?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes come along.

JOHN CLEESE:
Thank you.

MICHAEL PALIN:
But be careful. He's had a few. Mind you he's as good as gold in the morning, I've got to hand it to him, but come lunchtime it's a bottle of vin ordinaire - six glasses and he's ready to agitate.

DIRECTION:
Mrs Premise and Mrs Conclusion knock on the door of Jean-Paul's room.

JOHN CLEESE:
Coo-ee! Jean-Paul? Jean-Paul! It's only us. Oh pardon ... c'est même nous...

DIRECTION:
They enter. We do not see Jean-Paul although we hear his voice.

DIRECTION:
Oui.

JOHN CLEESE:
Jean-Paul. Your famous trilogy 'Rues à Liberté, is it an allegory of man's search for commitment?

DIRECTION:
Oui.

JOHN CLEESE:
I told you so.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh coitus.

DIRECTION:
Stock shot of a plane taking off

DIRECTION:
CAPTION: 'THE END'
