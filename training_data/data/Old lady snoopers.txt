ERIC IDLE:
Who's that shouting?

DIRECTION:
We pull out to reveal a sitting room full of high-powered eavesdropping equipment, i.e. an enormous telescope on wheels with a controller's chair attached to it, several subsidiary telescopes pointing out of the window, radar scanners going round and round, two computers with flashing lights, large and complex tape and video recorders, several TV monitors, oscilloscopes, aerials, etc. All these have been squeezed in amongst the furniture of two retired middle-class old ladies. Enid, a dear old lady with a bun, sits at the control seat of an impressive-looking console, pressing buttons. She also has some knitting.

JOHN CLEESE:
It's a man outside Number 24.

ERIC IDLE:
Try it on the five inch, Gladys.

DIRECTION:
looking at the array of telescopes

JOHN CLEESE:
I can't. I've got that fixed on the Baileys at Number 13. Their new lodger moves in today.

ERIC IDLE:
All fight, hold 13 on the five-inch and transfer the Cartwrights to the digital scanner.

DIRECTION:
Gladys leaps over to the tape deck, presses levers and switches. Sound of tape reversing. There is a hum and lights flash on and off. A blurred image of a lady in the street comes up on one of the monitors.

ERIC IDLE:
Hold on, Mrs Pettigrew's coming back from the doctor's.

JOHN CLEESE:
All right, bring her up on two. What's the duration reading on the oscillator?

ERIC IDLE:
48.47.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well that's a long time for someone who's just had a routine checkup.

DIRECTION:
reading a graph on a computer

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, her pulse rate's 146!

JOHN CLEESE:
Zoom in on the 16mm and hold her, Enid.

ERIC IDLE:
Roger, Gladys.

JOHN CLEESE:
I'll try and get her on the twelve-inch.

DIRECTION:
she dips into the control seat of the huge mobile telescope; we cut to the view through Gladys's telescope - out of focus at first, but then sharper as she zooms in towards the side door of Number 24

DIRECTION:
the curtain is opened a little

JOHN CLEESE:
Thank you, love.

DIRECTION:
Cut to the interior of Mrs Neves's kitchen once again. It is absolutely full of lifeboatmen. They are all talking happily and drinking cups of tea. We pick up the conversation between two them.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, it's one of those new self-righting models. Newhaven was about the first place in the country to get one.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What's the displacement on one of them jobs then?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh it's about 140-150 per square inch.

TERRY JONES:
Who's for fruit cake?

DIRECTION:
Oh yes, please, please.

TERRY JONES:
Yes, right, macaroons, that's two dozen fruit cakes, half a dozen macaroons. Right ho. Won't be a jiffy then.

DIRECTION:
She puts a scarf on, picks up a basket and goes out of the front door. As she opens door, we hear the sound of a storm which carries us into the next shot. Cut to the deck of a lifeboat; rain-lashed, heaving, wind-tossed Mrs Neves struggles against the gale force winds along the deck. She hammers on a hatch in the forward part of the lifeboat.

TERRY JONES:
Yoohoo! Mrs Edwards!

DIRECTION:
The hatch opens and a cosy shop-keeping pepperpot sticks her head out.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Hello.

TERRY JONES:
Hello, two dozen fruit cakes and half a dozen macaroons.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Sorry love, no macaroons. How about a nice vanilla sponge?

TERRY JONES:
Yes, that'll be lovely.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Right ho.

DIRECTION:
sound of a ship's horn; they both look

DIRECTION:
she produces a loudhailer

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Hello, Captain Smith?

DIRECTION:
Hallooooo!

DIRECTION:
Mrs Edwards hurls a box of Kup Kakes off deck.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Kup Kakes to starboard.

DIRECTION:
Coming.

TERRY JONES:
I'll pay you at the end of the week, all right?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
OK, right ho.

DIRECTION:
Mrs Neves struggles back along the deck. Cut to stock film of Ark Royal in a storm.

TERRY JONES:
Here; it's the

DIRECTION:
Ark Royal

TERRY JONES:
, Doris. Have you got their rock buns ready?

DIRECTION:
Sound of a ship's horn.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Hang on!

DIRECTION:
Doris appears at the hatch, and hands over two cake boxes.

JOHN CLEESE:
Here we are, five for them and five for HMS

DIRECTION:
Eagle

JOHN CLEESE:

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Right ho..

DIRECTION:
takes them and throws them both overboard; an officer climbs up the side of the boat

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes?

MICHAEL PALIN:
HMS

DIRECTION:
Defiant

MICHAEL PALIN:
? Two set teas please.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Two set teas, Doris. Forty-eight pence. There we are, thank you.

DIRECTION:
Money is handed over. The teas emerge on two little trays with delicate crockery, little teapots, milk jugs, etc.

MICHAEL PALIN:
By the way, do you do lunches?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, morning coffee and teas only.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right ho.

DIRECTION:
holding the teas he goes up to edge and jumps overboard
