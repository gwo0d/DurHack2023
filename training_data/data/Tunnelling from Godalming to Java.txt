MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, er, I think, David, this is something which Ron and myself are really keen on. Ron is going to tunnel from Godalming here to Java here.

JOHN CLEESE:
Java.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yeah, er, I, I personally think this is going to make Ron a household name overnight.

JOHN CLEESE:
And how far has he got?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Er, well, he's quite far now, Dave, well on the way. Well on the way, yeah.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well where is he exactly?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yeah.

JOHN CLEESE:
Where?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, er, well, er, you know, it's difficult to say exactly. He's er, you know, in the area of er, Ron, how far have you got?

TERRY JONES:
Oh about two foot six Mr Vercotti.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yeah well keep digging lad, keep digging.

TERRY JONES:
Mr Vercotti are you sure there isn't a spade?

JOHN CLEESE:
Er, Mr Verccotti, what do you say to people who accuse you of exploiting Ron for your own purposes?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, it's totally untrue, David. Ever since I left Sicily I've been trying to do the best for Ron. I know what Ron wants to do, I believe in him and I'm just trying to create the opportunities for Ron to do the kind of things he wants to do.

JOHN CLEESE:
And what's he going to do today?

MICHAEL PALIN:
He's going to split a railway carriage with his nose.

MICHAEL PALIN:
The only difficult bit for Ron is getting out of the Earth's atmosphere. Er, once he's in orbit he'll be able to run straight to Mercury.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I am now extremely hopeful that Ron will break the world record for remaining underground. He's a wonderful boy this, he's got this really enormous talent, this really huge talent.
