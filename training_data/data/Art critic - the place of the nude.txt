MICHAEL PALIN:
Good evening. I'd like to talk to you tonight about the place of the nude in my bed ... um ... in the history of my bed ... of art, of

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh hello there father, er confessor, professor, your honour, your grace ...

KATYA WYETH:
cutely

KATYA WYETH:
I'm not your Grace, I'm your Elsie.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What a terrible joke!

TERRY JONES:
We want to buy a bed, please.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Og, certainly, I'll, I'll get someone to help you.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Mr Verity!

ERIC IDLE:
Can I help you, sir?

TERRY JONES:
Er yes. We'd like to buy a bed...a double bed...about fifty pounds?

ERIC IDLE:
Oh no, I'm afraid not, sir. Our cheapest bed is eight hundred pounds, sir.

TERRY JONES:
Eight hundred pounds!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Or, er, perhaps I should have explained. Mr Verity does tend to exaggerate, so every figure he gives you will be ten times too high. Otherwise he's perfectly all right, perfectly ha, ha, ha.

TERRY JONES:
Oh I see. I see.

TERRY JONES:
So your cheapest bed then is eighty pounds?

ERIC IDLE:
Eight hundred pounds, yes, sir.

TERRY JONES:
And how wide is it?

ERIC IDLE:
Er, the width is, er, sixty feet wide.

TERRY JONES:
Oh...

TERRY JONES:
six foot wide, eh. And the length?

ERIC IDLE:
The length is ... er ...

ERIC IDLE:
Lambert! What is the length of the Comfydown Majorette?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Er, two foot long.

TERRY JONES:
Two foot long?

ERIC IDLE:
Ah yes, you have to remember of course, to multiply everything Mr Lambert says by three. Er, it's nothing he can help, you understand. Apart from that he's perfectly all right.

TERRY JONES:
I see, I'm sorry.

ERIC IDLE:
But it does mean that when he says a bed is two foot wide, it is in fact sixty foot wide.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, yes I see...

ERIC IDLE:
And that's not counting the mattress.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, how much is that?

ERIC IDLE:
Er, Mr Lambert will be able to help you there.

ERIC IDLE:
Lambert! Will you show these twenty good people the, er, dog kennels, please?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Mm? Certainly.

TERRY JONES:
Dog kennel? No, no, no, mattresses, mattresses!

ERIC IDLE:
Oh no, no you have to say dog kennel to Mr Lambert because if you say mattress he puts a bag over his head. I should have explained. Apart from that he's really all right.

TERRY JONES:
Ah, hum, er we'd like to see the dog kennels please.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Dog kennels?

TERRY JONES:
Yes, we want to see the dog kennels.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ah yes, well that's the pets' department. Second floor.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, no, no, we want to see the

TERRY JONES:
.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, pets department second floor.

TERRY JONES:
No, we don't really want to see dog kennels only your colleague said we ought to...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh dear, what's he been telling you now?

TERRY JONES:
Well, he said we should say dog kennels instead of mattress.

TERRY JONES:
Oh dear. Hello?

ERIC IDLE:
Did you say mattress?

TERRY JONES:
Well, a little yes.

ERIC IDLE:
I did

ERIC IDLE:
'And did those feet in ancient times, walk upon England's mountains green...'

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh dear, did somebody say mattress to Mr Lambert?

ERIC IDLE:
! (exits)

TERRY JONES:
Oh, no, no, no. er,, we'd like to see, see the dog kennels please?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, second floor.

TERRY JONES:
No, no, look these

TERRY JONES:
dog kennels here, see?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Mattresses?

TERRY JONES:
Oh

TERRY JONES:
...yes.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, if you meant mattress, why dodn't you

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
a mattress? I mean, it's very confusing for me if you go and say dog kennels when you mean mattress. Why not just say mattress?

TERRY JONES:
Well, I mean you put a bag over your head last time I said mattress.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Did somebody say mattress to Mr Lambert?

ERIC IDLE:
Twice.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hey, everybody, somebody said mattress to Mr Lambert, twice.

ERIC IDLE:
It's not working. We need more!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Now, er, can I help you?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
We want a mattress.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
But it's my only line!

TERRY JONES:
Full frontal nudity - not in this part of Esher.

JOHN CLEESE:
I would only perform in a scene in which there was full frontal nudity.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Now, I've noticed a tendency for this programme to get rather silly. Now I do my best to keep things moving along, but I'm not having things getting silly. Those two last sketches I did got very silly indeed, and that last one about the bed was even sillier. Now, nobody likes a good laugh more than I do...except perhaps my wife and some of her friends...oh yes and Captain Johnston. Come to think of it most people likes a good laugh more than I do. But that's beside the point. Now, let's have a good clean healthy outdoor sketch. Get some air into your lungs. Ten, nine, eight and all that.
