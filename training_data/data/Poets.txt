CAPTION: 'SALES MANAGER EAST MIDLANDS POET BOARD'

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, a poet is essential for complete home comfort, and all-year round reliability at low cost. We in the East Midlands Poet Board hope to have a poet in every home by the end of next year.

ANIMATION:

an advertisement.

DIRECTION:
singing

DIRECTION:
And most are far above the norm

Whether here, or on the roam

DIRECTION:
Have a poet in every home.

DIRECTION:
Cut to middle-class hall. The front doorbell rings. Housewife opens door to Gas Board type inspector with bicycle clips, rubber mac and cap and notebook. In the background we can hear muffled Wordsworth.

ERIC IDLE:
I wandered lonely as a cloud

DIRECTION:
That floats on high...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Morning, madam, I've come to read your poet.

TERRY JONES:
Oh yes, he's in the cupboard under the stairs.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What is it, a Swinburne? Shelley?

TERRY JONES:
No, it's a Wordsworth.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, bloody daffodils.

DIRECTION:
He opens the door of the cupboard under the stairs. Inside is Wordsworth crouching and reciting.

ERIC IDLE:
A host of golden daffodils

DIRECTION:
Beside the lake, beneath the trees

DIRECTION:
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze

DIRECTION:
All this while the inspector is shining his torch over him and noting things on his clip board.

ERIC IDLE:
Continuous as the stars that shine

DIRECTION:
And twinkle in the Milky Way

DIRECTION:
They stretch in...

DIRECTION:
The inspector shuts the door in the middle of this and we hear Wordsworth reading on, though muffled, throughout the remainder of the sketch.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right. Thank you, madam.

DIRECTION:
He makes as if to go, but she seems anxious to detain him and bars his way.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, not at all. Thank

DIRECTION:
you

TERRY JONES:
... It's a nice day, isn't it?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, yes, the weather situation is generally favourable. There's a ridge of high pressure centred over Ireland which is moving steadily eastward bringing cloudy weather to parts of the West Country, Wales and areas west of the Pennines. On tomorrow's chart ...

DIRECTION:
he reaches up and pulls down a big weather chart from the wall

MICHAEL PALIN:
the picture is much the same. With this occluded front bringing drier, warmer weather. Temperatures about average for the time of year. That's three degrees centigrade, forty-four degrees fahrenheit, so don't forget to wrap up well. That's all from me. Goodnight.
