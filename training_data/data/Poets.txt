JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, a poet is essential for complete home comfort, and all-year round reliability at low cost. We in the East Midlands Poet Board hope to have a poet in every home by the end of next year.

ERIC IDLE:

MICHAEL PALIN:
Morning, madam, I've come to read your poet.

TERRY JONES:
Oh yes, he's in the cupboard under the stairs.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What is it, a Swinburne? Shelley?

TERRY JONES:
No, it's a Wordsworth.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, bloody daffodils.

ERIC IDLE:
A host of golden daffodils

ERIC IDLE:
Continuous as the stars that shine

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right. Thank you, madam.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, not at all. Thank

TERRY JONES:
