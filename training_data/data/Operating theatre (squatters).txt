GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Brr brr

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'm afraid I'm going to have to operate. It's nothing to worry about although it is extremely dangerous. I shall be juggling with your life, I shall be playing ducks and drakes with your very existence, I shall be running me mitts over the pith of your marrow. Yes! These hands, these fingers, these sophisticated organs of touch, these bunches of five, these maulers, these German bands that have pulled many a moribund unfortunate back from the very brink of Lazarus's box. No, it was Pandora's box wasn't it? Well anyway these mitts have earned yours truly a lot of bread. So if you'll just step through here I'll slit you up a treat.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Mr Notlob, there's nothing wrong with you that an expensive operation can't prolong.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Right, I'm ready to make the incision. Knife please, sister

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh what a great slit. Now, gentlemen, I am going to open the slit.

ERIC IDLE:
Too much man, groovy, great scene. Great light show, baby.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What are you doing in there?

ERIC IDLE:
We're doing our own thing, man.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Have you got Mr Nottob's permission to be in there?

ERIC IDLE:
We're squatters, baby.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What?

ERIC IDLE:
Don't get uptight, man. Join the scene and other phrases. Money isn't real.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It is where I'm standing and it blows my mind, young lad.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Good Lord! Is that a nude woman?

ERIC IDLE:
She's doing an article on us for 'Nova', man.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Hi everyone. Are you part of the scene?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Are you rolling your own jelly babies in there?

MICHAEL PALIN:
What's going on? Who are they?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
That's what we are trying to find out.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What are they doing in my stomach?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
We don't know. Are they paying you any rent?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Of course they're not paying me rent!

ERIC IDLE:
You're not furnished, you fascist.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Get them out!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I can't.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Get them out.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No I can't. Not, not without a court order.

JOHN CLEESE:
You are hereby ordered to vacate Mr Notlob forthwith. And or.

ERIC IDLE:
Push off, fuzz.

JOHN CLEESE:
Right, that's it, we're going in. Release the vicious dogs.

JOHN CLEESE:
When this series returns it will be put out on Monday mornings as a test card and will be described by 'Radio Times' as a history of Irish agriculture.
