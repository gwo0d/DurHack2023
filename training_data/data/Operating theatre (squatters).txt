DIRECTION:
he is rising from seat

DIRECTION:
he puts needle down on ancient gramophone; Dr Kildare theme begins playing

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'm afraid I'm going to have to operate. It's nothing to worry about although it is extremely dangerous. I shall be juggling with your life, I shall be playing ducks and drakes with your very existence, I shall be running me mitts over the pith of your marrow. Yes! These hands, these fingers, these sophisticated organs of touch, these bunches of five, these maulers, these German bands that have pulled many a moribund unfortunate back from the very brink of Lazarus's box. No, it was Pandora's box wasn't it? Well anyway these mitts have earned yours truly a lot of bread. So if you'll just step through here I'll slit you up a treat.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Mr Notlob, there's nothing wrong with you that an expensive operation can't prolong.

DIRECTION:
Cut to operating theatre. The conversation and the guitar can still be heard. Notlob is on the table. His head is real but the rest of the body is false. Table is covered with green cloth for reality. Surgeon is swabbing. 'Going to the zoo' is still audible.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Right, I'm ready to make the incision. Knife please, sister

DIRECTION:
takes knife

DIRECTION:
takes big knife and strops it on steel sharpener

DIRECTION:
he stabs the body and makes a slit four feet long

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh what a great slit. Now, gentlemen, I am going to open the slit.

DIRECTION:
He pulls it apart. The song gets louder. The head of a squatter pops out.

ERIC IDLE:
Too much man, groovy, great scene. Great light show, baby.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What are you doing in there?

ERIC IDLE:
We're doing our own thing, man.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Have you got Mr Nottob's permission to be in there?

ERIC IDLE:
We're squatters, baby.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What?

DIRECTION:
to nurse about Notlob

DIRECTION:
she slaps his face

ERIC IDLE:
Don't get uptight, man. Join the scene and other phrases. Money isn't real.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It is where I'm standing and it blows my mind, young lad.

DIRECTION:
looks inside Notlob

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Good Lord! Is that a nude woman?

ERIC IDLE:
She's doing an article on us for 'Nova', man.

DIRECTION:
her head also appearing through slit

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Hi everyone. Are you part of the scene?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Are you rolling your own jelly babies in there?

DIRECTION:
waking up

MICHAEL PALIN:
What's going on? Who are they?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
That's what we are trying to find out.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What are they doing in my stomach?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
We don't know. Are they paying you any rent?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Of course they're not paying me rent!

ERIC IDLE:
You're not furnished, you fascist.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Get them out!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I can't.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Get them out.

No I can't. Not, not without a court order.

DIRECTION:
dives into slit

DIRECTION:
ANIMATION:

DIRECTION:
What a terrible way to end a series. Why couldn't it end with something like this?

DIRECTION:
a short piece of confusing animation later

DIRECTION:
Now there's an ending for you. Romance. Laughter.
