DIRECTION:
Cut to an undertaker's shop

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Morning.

JOHN CLEESE:
Good Morning.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What can I do for you, squire?

JOHN CLEESE:
Um, well, I wonder if you can help me. You see, my mother has just died.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ah well, we can help you. We deal with stiffs.

JOHN CLEESE:
What?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, there's three things we can do with your mum. We can bury her, burn her, or dump her.

JOHN CLEESE:
Dump her?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Dump her in the Thames.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, did you like her?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh well, we won't dump her, then. Well, what do you think? We can bury her or burn her.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, which do you recommend?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, they're both nasty. If we burn her, she gets stuffed in the flames, crackle, crackle, crackle, which is a bit of a shock if she's not quite dead, but quick.

DIRECTION:
the audience starts booing

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
and then we give you handful of ashes, which you can pretend are hers.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Or, if we bury her she gets eaten up lots of weevils, and nasty maggots,

DIRECTION:
the booing increases

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
which as I said before is a bit of a shock if she's not quite dead.

JOHN CLEESE:
I see. Well, she's definitely dead.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Where is she?

JOHN CLEESE:
She's in this sack.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Can I have a look? She looks quite young.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, yes, she was.

DIRECTION:
Increasing protests from audience

DIRECTION:
calling

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Fred!

ERIC IDLE:
Yeah?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I think we've got an eater.

DIRECTION:
Another undertaker pokes his head round the door

ERIC IDLE:
Right, I'll get the oven on.

DIRECTION:
goes off

JOHN CLEESE:
Er, excuse me, um, are you suggesting eating my mother?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Er ... Yeah. Not raw. Cooked.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, roasted with a few french fries, broccoli, horseradish sauce ...

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, I do feel a bit peckish.

DIRECTION:
Disgraceful! Boo!

DIRECTION:
etc.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Great!

JOHN CLEESE:
Can we have some parsnips?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Fred - get some parsnips.

JOHN CLEESE:
I really don't think I should.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Look, tell you what, we'll eat her, if you feel a bit guilty about it after, we can dig a grave and you can throw up in it.

DIRECTION:
A section of the audience rises up in revolt and invades the set, remonstrating with the performers and banging the counter, etc., breaking up the sketch. Zoom away from them and into caption machine; roll credits. The National Anthem starts. The shouting stops. Mix through credits to show audience and everyone on set standing to attention. As the credits end, fade out.
