GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Morning.

JOHN CLEESE:
Good Morning.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What can I do for you, squire?

JOHN CLEESE:
Um, well, I wonder if you can help me. You see, my mother has just died.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ah well, we can help you. We deal with stiffs.

JOHN CLEESE:
What?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, there's three things we can do with your mum. We can bury her, burn her, or dump her.

JOHN CLEESE:
Dump her?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Dump her in the Thames.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, did you like her?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh well, we won't dump her, then. Well, what do you think? We can bury her or burn her.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, which do you recommend?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, they're both nasty. If we burn her, she gets stuffed in the flames, crackle, crackle, crackle, which is a bit of a shock if she's not quite dead, but quick.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
and then we give you handful of ashes, which you can pretend are hers.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Or, if we bury her she gets eaten up lots of weevils, and nasty maggots,

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
which as I said before is a bit of a shock if she's not quite dead.

JOHN CLEESE:
I see. Well, she's definitely dead.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Where is she?

JOHN CLEESE:
She's in this sack.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Can I have a look? She looks quite young.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, yes, she was.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Fred!

ERIC IDLE:
Yeah?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I think we've got an eater.

ERIC IDLE:
Right, I'll get the oven on.

JOHN CLEESE:
Er, excuse me, um, are you suggesting eating my mother?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Er ... Yeah. Not raw. Cooked.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, roasted with a few french fries, broccoli, horseradish sauce ...

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, I do feel a bit peckish.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Great!

JOHN CLEESE:
Can we have some parsnips?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Fred - get some parsnips.

JOHN CLEESE:
I really don't think I should.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Look, tell you what, we'll eat her, if you feel a bit guilty about it after, we can dig a grave and you can throw up in it.
