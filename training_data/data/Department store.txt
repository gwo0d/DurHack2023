Establishing shot of large Harrods-type store. Outside limousines and taxis are disgorging very rich customers. Small doormen in enormously large coats opening door of cars. A man with his nose bandaged comes out of the store. One large car pulls softly up to the curb, and as small doorman (Michael) opens its door, an enormously opulent lady (Terry J) in furs gets out. The doorman holds the door open. She knees him in the groin and walks on into the store. Chris Quinn (Eric) arrives on a bicycle. He parks the bicycle against the curb (the doorman flings it into the road) and goes into the outer hall of the store. He passes a couple leaving who also have noses bandaged. A gaggle of customers, mostly pepperpots, rush out. A very eager pepperpot lady shopper, going the other way, rushes between the two and bangs into a set of glass doors which have closed behind the gaggle. She cries out with pain clutching her nose and is escorted away by a large, coated attendant. Chris Quinn looks up at the list on the wall. It reads:

Quinn, knowing that there are doors, goes forward more cautiously and enters. The banging of noses on glass doors is a constant background theme. Cut to the gift department. A large lady is standing by counter holding a large cylinder with a rose attachment.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Yes this looks the sort of thing. May I just try it?

TERRY GILLIAM:
Certainly, madam.

DIRECTION:
The lady presses button and a sheet of flame shoots out across the hall.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh! Sorry!

DIRECTION:
So

DIRECTION:
she is happy though

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Yes that's fine.

TERRY GILLIAM:
Is that on account, madam?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Yes.

DIRECTION:
Chris walks by, watching with interest but not much concern, passing a customer whose back is on fire but who has not noticed. He approaches a counter with a sign saying 'Ant Counter'. He stands by the apparently empty counter for one moment, then rings a bell.
