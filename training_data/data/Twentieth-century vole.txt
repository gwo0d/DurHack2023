ANIMATION,

DIRECTION:
which leads us to the 'Twentieth Century Vole' trademark. Cut to film producer's office. Six writers sitting round a table with one very impressive chair empty at the head of the table. They wait reverently. Suddenly the door of the room flies open and Larry Saltzberg, the film producer, walks in. The writers leap to their feet.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Good morning boys.

DIRECTION:
Good morning Mr Saltzberg.

DIRECTION:
They run to help him into his chair.

DIRECTION:
sitting

DIRECTION:
the writers are overcome

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I want you to know that I've had an idea for the next movie I'm going to produce and I want you boys to write it.

DIRECTION:
The writers run and kiss him.

DIRECTION:
Thank you. Thank you.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh sit down! Sit down! Sit down! There'll be plenty of time for that later on. Now boys, here's my idea...

ERIC IDLE:
It's great!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You like it huh?

DIRECTION:
he looks round the table

DIRECTION:
catching on fast

DIRECTION:
first writer is the only one not having an orgasm about the idea

DIRECTION:
to first writer

DIRECTION:

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yeah! Er ... yeah.

DIRECTION:

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh well you haven't told us... what it is yet...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:

DIRECTION:
pointing at sixth writer

IAN DAVIDSON:
I ... I ... I ... agree with them.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Good! Now we're getting somewhere. Now, here's the start of the movie ... I see snow!

DIRECTION:
writers applaud

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
White snow!

JOHN CLEESE:
Think of the colours!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
And in the snow, I see ... a tree!

DIRECTION:
applauding

DIRECTION:
Yes! Yes!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Wait, wait I haven't finished yet.

ERIC IDLE:
There's

DIRECTION:
more

ERIC IDLE:
?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
And by this tree, gentlemen, I see ... a dog!

DIRECTION:
Ol√©!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
And gentlemen, this dog goes up to the tree, and he piddles on it.

DIRECTION:
Hallelujah!

DIRECTION:
Have we got a movie!

TERRY GILLIAM:
He tells it the way it is!

JOHN CLEESE:
It's where it's at!

ERIC IDLE:
This is something else!

TERRY JONES:
It's out of sight!

DIRECTION:
finding Larry staring at him

MICHAEL PALIN:
I like it, I like it.

DIRECTION:
suspicious

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh yeah?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yeah, yeah, I

DIRECTION:
promise

MICHAEL PALIN:
I like it

TERRY GILLIAM:
Sir, I don't know how to say this but I got to be perfectly frank. I really and truly believe this story of yours is the greatest story in motion-picture history.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Get out!

TERRY GILLIAM:
What?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
If there's one thing I can't stand, it's a yes-man! Get out!

DIRECTION:
fifth writer leaves very fast, the others go very quiet

DIRECTION:
to sixth writer

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What do you think?

DIRECTION:
Well... I...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Just because I have an idea it doesn't mean it's great. It could be lousy.

DIRECTION:
It could?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yeah! What d'ya think?

DIRECTION:
It's lousy.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
There you are, you see, he spoke his mind. He said my idea was lousy. It just so happens my idea isn't lousy so get out you goddam pinko subversive, get out!

DIRECTION:
sixth writer exits

DIRECTION:
looking straight at fourth writer

JOHN CLEESE:
Well ... I think it's an excellent idea.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Are you a yes-man?

JOHN CLEESE:
No, no, no, I mean there may be things against it.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You think it's lousy, huh?

JOHN CLEESE:
No, no, I mean it takes time.

DIRECTION:
really threatening

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Are you being indecisive?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yo. Nes. Perhaps.

DIRECTION:
runs out

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I hope you three gentlemen aren't going to be indecisive!

DIRECTION:
they try to hide under the table

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What the hell are you doing under that table?

MICHAEL PALIN:
We dropped our pencils.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Pencil droppers, eh?

DIRECTION:
No, no, no, no, no!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Right. Now I want your opinion of my idea ...

DIRECTION:
pointing at first writer

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You...

DIRECTION:
quaking

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh...

DIRECTION:
First writer looks around and then faints.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Has he had a heart attack?

DIRECTION:
Er...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
If there's one thing I can't stand, it's people who have heart attacks.

DIRECTION:
recovering immediately

MICHAEL PALIN:
I feel fine now.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, what do you think?

DIRECTION:
Oh! Eh! You didn't ask me you asked him. He didn't ask me, he asked him. No, him.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I've changed my mind. I'm asking you, the one in the middle.

TERRY JONES:
The one in the middle?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, the one in the middle.

DIRECTION:
the phone rings

DIRECTION:
all jockey for position desperately trying to put the others in the middle and finish sitting on one chair

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What the hell are you doing?

TERRY JONES:
I'm thinking.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Get back in those seats immediately.

DIRECTION:
back to phone

DIRECTION:
second writer is grabbed by the others and held in the middle chair; Larry finishes with the phone

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Right you. The one in the middle, what do you think?

DIRECTION:
panic

TERRY JONES:
Er... er...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Come on!

TERRY JONES:
Splunge.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Did he say splunge?

DIRECTION:
Yes.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What does splunge mean?

TERRY JONES:
It means ... it's a great-idea-but-possibly-not-and-I'm-not-being-indecisive!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Good. Right . ..

DIRECTION:
to third writer

ERIC IDLE:
Er. Splunge?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
OK...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yeah. Splunge for me too.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
So all three of you think splunge, huh?

DIRECTION:
Yes!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well now we're getting somewhere. No, wait. A new angle! In the snow, instead of the tree, I see Rock Hudson, and instead of the dog I see Doris Day and, gentlemen, Doris Day goes up to Rock Hudson and she kisses him. A love story. Intercourse Italian style. David Hemmings as a hippy Gestapo officer. Frontal nudity. A family picture. A comedy. And then when Doris Day's kissed Rock Hudson she says something funny like...

DIRECTION:
looks at third writer

ERIC IDLE:
Er ... Good evening.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Doris Day's a comedienne, not a newsreader. Get out!

DIRECTION:
third writer runs

DIRECTION:
looks at second writer

TERRY JONES:
Splunge?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
That's the stupidest idea I ever heard. Get out!

DIRECTION:
second writer leaves

DIRECTION:
looks at first writer

MICHAEL PALIN:
Er... er... er... I can't take it anymore.

DIRECTION:
runs out

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I like that! I like that, I can't take it any more, and then Rock Hudson says 'I'm a very rich film producer and I need a lobotomy' and then Doris Dog says 'I think you're very handsome and I'm going to take all my clothes off' and then Doris Dog turns into a yak and goes to the bathroom on David Lemming. No, wait, wait!
