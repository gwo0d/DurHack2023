GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Good morning boys.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I want you to know that I've had an idea for the next movie I'm going to produce and I want you boys to write it.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh sit down! Sit down! Sit down! There'll be plenty of time for that later on. Now boys, here's my idea...

ERIC IDLE:
It's great!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You like it huh?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
like it?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yeah! Er ... yeah.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
about it?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh well you haven't told us... what it is yet...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
WHAT!?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I like what he likes.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What do you like?

TERRY JONES:
I like what he likes.

ERIC IDLE:
I like what he likes.

JOHN CLEESE:
I like what he likes

TERRY GILLIAM:
I just crazy about what he likes

IAN DAVIDSON:
I ... I ... I ... agree with them.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Good! Now we're getting somewhere. Now, here's the start of the movie ... I see snow!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
White snow!

JOHN CLEESE:
Think of the colours!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
And in the snow, I see ... a tree!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Wait, wait I haven't finished yet.

ERIC IDLE:
There's

ERIC IDLE:
?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
And by this tree, gentlemen, I see ... a dog!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
And gentlemen, this dog goes up to the tree, and he piddles on it.

TERRY GILLIAM:
He tells it the way it is!

JOHN CLEESE:
It's where it's at!

ERIC IDLE:
This is something else!

TERRY JONES:
It's out of sight!

MICHAEL PALIN:
I like it, I like it.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh yeah?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yeah, yeah, I

MICHAEL PALIN:
I like it

TERRY GILLIAM:
Sir, I don't know how to say this but I got to be perfectly frank. I really and truly believe this story of yours is the greatest story in motion-picture history.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Get out!

TERRY GILLIAM:
What?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
If there's one thing I can't stand, it's a yes-man! Get out!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What do you think?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Just because I have an idea it doesn't mean it's great. It could be lousy.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yeah! What d'ya think?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
There you are, you see, he spoke his mind. He said my idea was lousy. It just so happens my idea isn't lousy so get out you goddam pinko subversive, get out!

JOHN CLEESE:
Well ... I think it's an excellent idea.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Are you a yes-man?

JOHN CLEESE:
No, no, no, I mean there may be things against it.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You think it's lousy, huh?

JOHN CLEESE:
No, no, I mean it takes time.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Are you being indecisive?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yo. Nes. Perhaps.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I hope you three gentlemen aren't going to be indecisive!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What the hell are you doing under that table?

MICHAEL PALIN:
We dropped our pencils.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Pencil droppers, eh?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Right. Now I want your opinion of my idea ...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Has he had a heart attack?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
If there's one thing I can't stand, it's people who have heart attacks.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I feel fine now.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, what do you think?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I've changed my mind. I'm asking you, the one in the middle.

TERRY JONES:
The one in the middle?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, the one in the middle.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What the hell are you doing?

TERRY JONES:
I'm thinking.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Get back in those seats immediately.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Right you. The one in the middle, what do you think?

TERRY JONES:
Er... er...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Come on!

TERRY JONES:
Splunge.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Did he say splunge?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What does splunge mean?

TERRY JONES:
It means ... it's a great-idea-but-possibly-not-and-I'm-not-being-indecisive!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Good. Right . ..

ERIC IDLE:
Er. Splunge?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
OK...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yeah. Splunge for me too.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
So all three of you think splunge, huh?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well now we're getting somewhere. No, wait. A new angle! In the snow, instead of the tree, I see Rock Hudson, and instead of the dog I see Doris Day and, gentlemen, Doris Day goes up to Rock Hudson and she kisses him. A love story. Intercourse Italian style. David Hemmings as a hippy Gestapo officer. Frontal nudity. A family picture. A comedy. And then when Doris Day's kissed Rock Hudson she says something funny like...

ERIC IDLE:
Er ... Good evening.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Doris Day's a comedienne, not a newsreader. Get out!

TERRY JONES:
Splunge?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
That's the stupidest idea I ever heard. Get out!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Er... er... er... I can't take it anymore.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I like that! I like that, I can't take it any more, and then Rock Hudson says 'I'm a very rich film producer and I need a lobotomy' and then Doris Dog says 'I think you're very handsome and I'm going to take all my clothes off' and then Doris Dog turns into a yak and goes to the bathroom on David Lemming. No, wait, wait!
