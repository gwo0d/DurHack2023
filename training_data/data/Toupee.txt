TERRY JONES:
Don't worry, sir, you're among friends now, sir.

TERRY JONES:
These are our fitters, sir. We've had a lot of experience in this field and we do pride ourselves we offer the best and most discreet service available. I don't know whether you'll believe this sir, but one of us is actually wearing a toupee at this moment...

ERIC IDLE:
Well, you all are, aren't you?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Have you got one?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, but I didn't know...

TERRY JONES:
I didn't realize that you two... I thought it was me,

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, I thought it was me.

MICHAEL PALIN:
So did I.

MICHAEL PALIN:
That is good.

ERIC IDLE:
Actually, I only came in here to ask where the manager's office was.

TERRY JONES:
Just a minute - someone told you we all had toupees?

ERIC IDLE:
No.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh yeah?

MICHAEL PALIN:
How did you know?

ERIC IDLE:
Well ... it's pretty obvious, isn't it?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What do you mean obvious! His is undetectable.

ERIC IDLE:
Well, it's a different colour, for a start.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Is it?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Course it isn't!

ERIC IDLE:
And it doesn't fit in with the rest of his hair... it sort of sticks up in the middle.

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's better than yours.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes.

ERIC IDLE:
I'm not wearing one.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, I see, you haven't got one.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Why did you come in here then?

ERIC IDLE:
They told me to find the manager's office here.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh no, not again.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
That's a bit lame, isn't it...

ERIC IDLE:
It's the truth!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yeah, look at it. Where did you get that, Mac Fisheries?

TERRY JONES:
Dreadful, isn't it?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Nylon?

ERIC IDLE:
It's not, it's real look.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Come on, get if off.

ERIC IDLE:
Get away.

TERRY JONES:
Look, do you want a proper one?

ERIC IDLE:
No, I don't need one.

MICHAEL PALIN:
There's no need to be ashamed.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
We've all owned up.

TERRY JONES:
Don't you see... this is something you've got to come to terms with.

ERIC IDLE:
I am not wearing a toupee! They just told me to come in here to find the manager's office, to complain about my ant!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Pathetic, isn't it.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Complain about an ant?

TERRY JONES:
This is for your own good.
