ad the sketch fails to start they point up at a nearby building

DIRECTION:
The camera pans to a window in the building. Cut to the office inside, where a board meeting is taking place. The Chairman is Mr Tid.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Gentlemen, we have two basic suggestions for the design of this...

DIRECTION:
he is distracted by the two Gumbys still shouting

DIRECTION:
shouts out of window at the gumbys

DIRECTION:
but the gumbys is still shouting 'Architects Sketch'; he throws a bucket of water over them; they subside, damply

DIRECTION:
knock at door

DIRECTION:
Mr Wiggin comes in

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ah, yes - it's Mr Wiggin of Ironside and Malone.

DIRECTION:
Wiggin walks to the table on which his model stand.

JOHN CLEESE:
Good morning, gentlemen. This is a twelwe-storey block combining classical neo-Georgian features with the efficiency of modern techniques. The tenants arrive in the entrance hall here, and are carried along the corridor on a conveyor belt in extreme comfort and past murals depicting Mediterranean scenes, towards the rotating knives. The last twenty feet of the corridor are heavily soundproofed. The blood pours down these chutes and the mangled flesh slurps into these...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Excuse me....

JOHN CLEESE:
Hm?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Did you say knives?

JOHN CLEESE:
Rotating knives, yes.

TERRY JONES:
Are you proposing to slaughter our tenants?

JOHN CLEESE:
Does that not fit in with your plans?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, it does not. We asked for a simple block of flats.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, I see. I hadn't correctly divined your attitude towards your tenants. You see I mainly design slaughter houses. Yes, pity. Mind you, this is a real beaut. I mean, none of your blood caked on the walls and flesh flying out of the windows, inconveniencing the passers-by with this one. I mean, my life has been building up to this.

TERRY JONES:
Yes, and well done, but we want a block of flats.

JOHN CLEESE:
May I ask you to reconsider. I mean, you wouldn't regret it. Think of the tourist trade.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, no, it's just that we wanted a block of flats, not an abattoir.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, well, of course, this is just the sort blinkered philistine pig ignorance I've come to expect from you non-creative garbage. You sit there on your loathsome, spotty behinds squeezing blackheads, not caring a tinker's cuss about the struggling artist.

DIRECTION:
shouting

JOHN CLEESE:
You excrement! You lousy hypocritical whining toadies with your lousy colour TV sets and your Tony Jacklin golf clubs and your bleeding masonic handshakes! You wouldn't let me join, would you, you blackballing bastards. Well I wouldn't become a freemason now if you went down on your lousy, stinking, purulent knees and begged me.

TERRY JONES:
Well, we're sorry you feel like that but we, er, did want a block of flats. Nice though the abattoir is.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh

DIRECTION:
blows raspberry

JOHN CLEESE:
the abattoir, that's not important. But if any of you could put in a word for me I'd love to be a freemason. Freemasonry opens doors. I mean, I was...I was a bit on edge just now, but if I were a mason I'd sit at the back and not get in anyone's way.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Thank you.

JOHN CLEESE:
I've got a second-hand apron.

TERRY JONES:
Thank you.

DIRECTION:
going to door but stopping

JOHN CLEESE:
I nearly got in at Hendon.

DIRECTION:
Mr Wiggin leaves and the familiar figure of Mr Tid comes forward.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'm sorry about that, gentlemen. The second architect is Mr Leavey of Wymis and Dibble.

DIRECTION:
Mr Leavey comes in and goes to his model.

ERIC IDLE:
Good morning gentlemen. This is a scale model of the block. There are twenty-eight storeys, with two hundred and eighty modern apartments. There are three main lifts and two service lifts. Access would be from Dibbingley Road.

DIRECTION:
the model falls over, and he quickly puts it upright

DIRECTION:
the model falls over again

DIRECTION:
he puts model upright and holds onto it

DIRECTION:
the model partly collapses, the bottom ten floors giving way

DIRECTION:
the model is smoking and flames are seen

ERIC IDLE:
we have almost totally removed the risk of...

DIRECTION:
SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'SATIRE'

ERIC IDLE:
Quite frankly, I think the central pillar system may need strengthening a bit.

TERRY JONES:
Isn't that going to put the cost up?

ERIC IDLE:
It might.

TERRY JONES:
Well, I don't know whether I'd worry about strengthening

DIRECTION:
that

TERRY JONES:
much. After all, they're not meant to be luxury flats.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I quite agree. I mean, providing the tenants are of light build and relatively sedentary and er, given a spot of good weather, I think we're on to a winner here.

ERIC IDLE:
Thank you.

DIRECTION:
The model explodes.

TERRY JONES:
Quite agree. Quite agree.

ERIC IDLE:
Thank you very much. Thank you.

DIRECTION:
he shakes hands with them in an extraordinary way

DIRECTION:
at door

JOHN CLEESE:
It opens doors, I'm telling you.

ERIC IDLE:
Let's have a look at that handshake again in slow motion.

DIRECTION:
CAPTION: 'BBC TV ACTION REPLAY'

DIRECTION:
They do the handshake again, only slowly.
