Cut to backdrop of a circus ring. In front of it, as if in the ring, stand the RSM and Mr Man. Mr Man is as before. The RSM is dressed the same except that over his uniform he wears baggy trousers and braces and a funny nose. He is responding to the audience applause. Mr Man has obviously just been drenched with hot water - he is soaked and steam is rising.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you and now for the fish - the fish down the trousers.

DIRECTION:
the RSM picks up fish and puts it down Mr Man's trousers

DIRECTION:
the RSM pours a bucket of whitewash over him

DIRECTION:
more laughter, the RSM puts custard pie in his face and knees him in the balls

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It's not my mush - it's your mush. It's your laugh - it's your laugh mate - not mine. It's your bleeding laugh.

DIRECTION:
Cut to stock film of Mr Heath laughing followed by stock film of Women's Institute applauding.
