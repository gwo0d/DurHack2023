TERRY JONES:
We admit that there have been outbreaks of hanging recently, but the police are trying to keep the situatuon under control.

DIRECTION:
his personal two-way radio is making rather a noise

DIRECTION:
claps his hand over the radio to little avail

TERRY JONES:
Electrocutions are another big worry. But we hope that guillotining has been eradicated from the urban areas. and garrotting is confined almost entirely to Luton. So if you have a friend in prison or under the sentence of death, be sure to let us know at this address.

DIRECTION:
and CAPTION:

ERIC IDLE:
'THE POLICE FORCE, "SUNNYVIEW", YEOVIL, SOMERSET'

DIRECTION:
Cut to a mortuary. Various trolleys lie about with corpses covered by sheets. Two workers are sitting at a low make-shift table with cups of tea and a transistor radio, shelling eggs and dropping them in a pickling jar.

JOHN CLEESE:
... and Premier Chou En Lai, who called it 'a major breakthrough'. Twelve men were accidentally hanged at Whitby Assizes this afternoon whilst considering their verdict. This is one of the worst miscarriages of justice in Britain since Tuesday.

DIRECTION:
music

ERIC IDLE:
Well it's thirteen minutes to the hour of nine-nine-nine, here on wonderful Radio One-One-One! So if you're still lying in your big big bed, now is the time to get up out of it! We've got another thirteen hours of tip-top sounds here on Wonderful Radio One!

DIRECTION:
brief funny noises

ERIC IDLE:
Sorry about that ... So unless you have brain cells, or have completed the process of evolution, there's a wonderful day ahead!

DIRECTION:
switching the radio off

DIRECTION:
he gets another radio out from underneath the table

DIRECTION:
he gets another radio out

DIRECTION:
he opens the top of the third radio and gets out a fourth; he switches it on

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It's 9 o'clock and time for 'Mortuary Hour'. An hour of talks, tunes and downright tomfoolery for all those who work in mortuaries, introduced as usual by Shirley Bassey.

DIRECTION:
sinister chords

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Well, we're going to kick straight off this week with our Mortuary Quiz, so have your pens and pencils ready.

DIRECTION:
A door at the back of the mortuary opens and Mr Wang, an official of the Department of Stiffs, enters. He wears an undertaker's suit and top hat plus a long blond wig.

JOHN CLEESE:
Turn that radio off and look lively!

TERRY JONES:
Oh, it's 'Mortuary Quiz', Mr Wang...

JOHN CLEESE:
Don't argue, Battersby.

DIRECTION:
We hear voices off. Officials at the door spring to attention. Enter a mayor with a chain round his neck, and an elderly peer of the realm who is standing on a small platform, pushed by an attendant.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
... This is our mortuary in here, Your Grace ...

MICHAEL PALIN:
I see, I see, I ... er ... I ... er ... I ... er ... I ... I can't think of anything to say about it.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, we're very proud of it here, sir. It's one of the most up to date in the country.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I see... yes... yes ... now... um... what... what... ah... ah... what is it? .... is it a power station?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, Your Grace, it's a mortuary.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I see ... I see ... good ... good ... good, good, good...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
But it has one of the most advanced thermostat control systems in the country, and it has computer-controlled storage facilities.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I see, I see ... I ... er... er... er... er ... I ... er ... I'm a good little doggie.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'm sorry, Your Grace?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'm a good little dog.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh dear...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Perhaps we should postpone the visit?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
No, no, no - you see it's just that his brain is so tiny that the slightest movement can dislodge it

DIRECTION:
starts to slap the duke's head from side to side gently but firmly

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Your Grace ... Oh dear... it's rather like one of those games you play where you have to get the ball into the hole ... That's it.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah! Now then, excellent, excellent, excellent, excellent. Now then ... ah ... what happens when the steel is poured into the ingots?

DIRECTION:
ushering everyone out

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Perhaps we should go and have a look at the new showers?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes... yes ... yes ... yes... yes rather jolly good... jolly good .. jolly good ... jolly good ... no fear...

DIRECTION:
They leave. Battersby turns the radio on again.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Well the answers were as follows: 1) the left hand, 2) no, 3) normal, 4) yes it has, in 1963 when a bird got caught in the mechanism. How did you get on?

DIRECTION:
Two men behind him push in a trolley with sheet-covered corpses on it.

JOHN CLEESE:
Turn that thing off!

TERRY JONES:
Oh! It's 'Mortuary Dance Time', Mr Wang!

JOHN CLEESE:
Never mind that, Battersby, this is the big one. I've just had Whitby Police on the phone with twelve hangees...

TERRY JONES:
Oh yes, I just heard about that on the radios ...

JOHN CLEESE:
No, these are twelve different ones ... so shtoom.

DIRECTION:
Battersby and friend gather round the body. Wang joins them. They start to work away busily and eficiently on the corpse. We suddenly become aware that Badger is standing with them around the body.

ERIC IDLE:
I'll not interrupt this sketch for a pound.

JOHN CLEESE:
What?

ERIC IDLE:
For one pound I'll leave this sketch totally uninterrupted.

ERIC IDLE:
Fifty pence ... I'm prepared to negotiate a forty-pence deal.

DIRECTION:
an eye peers out from under the sheet on the corpse they are working on

ERIC IDLE:
For 35p I won't interrupt any of the next three items.

DIRECTION:
The corpse is now sitting up waiting to see what happens. Another corpse sits up as they continue arguing. The sheet is pushed back on another trolley revealing a boy and girl on the same stretcher. They light cigarettes.

JOHN CLEESE:
No, no, it's no good...

ERIC IDLE:
25p.

JOHN CLEESE:
No.

ERIC IDLE:
10p and a kiss.
