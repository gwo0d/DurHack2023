ANIMATION:

DIRECTION:
a sketch advertising Crelm Toothpaste. Cut to a soap powder commercial. Slick adman against neutral background. On his left is an ordinary kitchen table. On his right is a pile of sheets on a stand.

ERIC IDLE:
This table has been treated with ordinary soap powder, but these have been treated with new Fibro-Val.

DIRECTION:
cut to top shot of interior of washing machine with water spinning round as per ads

DIRECTION:
cut back to the original set-up; the sheets are obviously painted white; the table is smashed up

ERIC IDLE:
The table is broken and smashed, but the sheets, with Fibro-Val, are sparkling clean and white.

DIRECTION:
Traditional expanding square links to next commercial. Animated countryside with flowers, butterflies and Babycham animal. A boy and a girl (real, superimposed) wander through hand in hand.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I love the surgical garment. Enjoy the delights of the Victor Mature abdominal corset. Sail down the Nile on the Bleed-it Kosher Truss.

DIRECTION:
the adman comes into view over the background; he holds a tailor's dummy - pelvis only - with a truss

MICHAEL PALIN:
And don't forget the Hercules Hold-'em-in, the all.purpose concrete truss for the man with the family hernia.
