DIRECTION:
Cut to a similar landscape. Preparations for an expedition are underway: equipment being piled into land-rovers etc. An interviewer walks into shot.

JOHN CLEESE:
Hello. All the activity you can see in progress here is part of the intricate... aah!

DIRECTION:
he steps into a man-trap, but continues bravely

DIRECTION:
the interviewer in slightly different spot with the admiral; we now see that the interviewer has a wooden leg and a crutch

JOHN CLEESE:
Sir Jane, what is the purpose of your expedition?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well this is a completely uncharted lake with like hitherto unclassified marine life man, so the whole scene's wide open for a scientific exploration.

DIRECTION:
now with a parrot on his shoulder

JOHN CLEESE:
One can see the immense amount of preparation involved. Have there been many difficulties in setting up this venture?

DIRECTION:
with 'naval-lib' badge

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well the real hang-up was with the bread man but when the top brass pigs came through we got it together in a couple of moons. Commodore Betty Grable, who's a real sub-aqua head, has got it together diving wise and like the whole gig's been a real gas man.

DIRECTION:
now with Long John Silver hat

DIRECTION:
and eyepatch

JOHN CLEESE:
Lieutenant Commander Dorothy Lamour.

DIRECTION:
Pieces of eight.

DIRECTION:
now with Long John Silver jacket

JOHN CLEESE:
Dorothy you're in charge of security and liason for this operation.

ERIC IDLE:
Right on.

DIRECTION:
he is smoking something and is really cool

JOHN CLEESE:
You've kept this all rather hush-hush so far shipmate.

ERIC IDLE:
Yeah, it's been really heavy man with all these freaks from the fascist press trying to blow the whole scene.

DIRECTION:
to camera

DIRECTION:
he is hit by a dart

JOHN CLEESE:
Argh! A tranquillizing dart fired by the cowardly BBC health department dogs ... they've done filled me full of chlorpromazine damn!

DIRECTION:
He falls. A second interviewer comes into shot and catches the microphone.

TERRY JONES:
I'm sorry about my colleague's rather unconventional behaviour.

DIRECTION:
running towards the camera

MICHAEL PALIN:
The navy's out of sight man come together with the RN it's really something other than else.

DIRECTION:
Animated psychedelic advert for the Royal Navy.

DIRECTION:
You dig it, man?

DIRECTION:
Cut back to second interviewer.

TERRY JONES:
Hello. I'm sorry about my colleague's rather unconventional behaviour just now, but things haven't been too easy for him recently, trouble at home, rather confidential so I can't give you all the details... interesting though they are... three bottles of rum with his Weetabix, and so on, anyway... apparently the girl wasn't even ... anyway the activity you see behind me... it's the mother I feel sorry for. I'll start again. The activity you see behind me is part of the preparations for the new Naval Expedition to Lake Pahoe. The man in charge of this expedition is Vice Admiral Sir John Cunningham. Sir John, hello there.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ah, hello. Well first of all I'd like to apologize for the behaviour of certain of my colleagues you may have seen earlier, but they are from broken homes, circus families and so on and they are in no way representative of the new modern improved British Navy. They are a small vociferous minority; and may I take this opportunity of emphasizing that there is no cannibalism in the British Navy. Absolutely none, and when I say none, I mean there is a certain amount, more than we are prepared to admit, but all new ratings are warned that if they wake up in the morning and find any toothmarks at all anywhere on their bodies, they're to tell me immediately so that I can immediately take every measure to hush the whole thing up. And, finally, necrophilia is right out.

DIRECTION:
the interviewer keeps nodding but looks embarrassed

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Now, this expedition is primarily to investigate reports of cannibalism and necrophilia in... this expedition is primarily to investigate reports of unusual marine life in the as yet uncharted Lake Pahoe.

TERRY JONES:
And where exactly is the lake?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Er 22A, Runcorn Avenue, I think. Yes, that's right, 22A.

TERRY JONES:
Runcorn Avenue?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, it's just by Blenheim Crescent... do you know it?

TERRY JONES:
You mean it's in an ordinary street?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Of course it's not an ordinary street! It's got a lake in it!

TERRY JONES:
Yes but I...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Look, how many streets do you know that have got lakes in them?

TERRY JONES:
But you mean... is it very large?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Of

DIRECTION:
course

DIRECTION:
looking off camera

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Jenkins ... no!

DIRECTION:
We see a rather sheepish rating about to sink his teeth into a human leg. Sir John puts his hand in front of the lens. Cut to Runcorn Avenue, an ordinary street with houses now turned into flats. The land-rover arrives with the equipment.

TERRY JONES:
I'm now standing in Runcorn Avenue. Sir John ... where exactly is the lake?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Er, well let's see, that's 18... that's 20 so this must be the one.

TERRY JONES:
Er, excuse me...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, that's the one all right.

TERRY JONES:
But it's an ordinary house.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Look, I'm getting pretty irritated with this line of questioning.

TERRY JONES:
But it doesn't even look like a lake...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Look, your whole approach since this interview started has been to mock the Navy. When I think that it was for the likes of you that I had both my legs blown off...

DIRECTION:
pointing at perfectly healthy legs

TERRY JONES:
You haven't had both your legs blown off!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I was talking metaphorically you fool. Jenkins - put that down.

DIRECTION:
Jenkins returns the leg to the land-rover

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Right, is the equipment ready?

ERIC IDLE:
Diving equipment all ready man.

DIRECTION:
gives hippy salute

DIRECTION:
warning finger

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Right. Now quite simply the approach to Lake Pahoe is up the steps, and then we come to the shores of the lake. Now, I'm going to press the bell just to see if there's anyone in.

DIRECTION:
answering

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hello?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Good morning - I'm looking for a Lake Pahoe.

MICHAEL PALIN:
There's a Mr Padgett.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no a

DIRECTION:
lake

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
.

MICHAEL PALIN:
There's no lake here, mate. This is Runcorn Avenue. What's the camera doing?

DIRECTION:
coming out

DIRECTION:
grins at the camera

MICHAEL PALIN:
He's looking for a lake.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Lake Pahoe.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, you want downstairs, 22A the basement.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ah! Thank you very much. Good morning. Come on men, downstairs.

DIRECTION:
They walk down to the basement. The interviewer intercepts Sir John.

TERRY JONES:
Were you successful, Sir John?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It's in the basement.

TERRY JONES:
In the basement?

DIRECTION:
He sees a parrot on his shoulder.

DIRECTION:
Pieces of eight.

TERRY JONES:
Eugh!

DIRECTION:
he knocks it off

DIRECTION:
Sir John goes to the front door of 22A and rings. Then he looks into the living room through the window. A middle-aged couple are sitting inside. The room is full of water. The man reads the paper and the woman knits. Both wear breathing apparatus. Sir John knocks on the window. The woman looks up.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Hello.

JOHN CLEESE:
Ooooh. I think it's someone about the damp.

ERIC IDLE:
Tell 'em about the bleeding rats, too.

JOHN CLEESE:
I'll go

DIRECTION:
she swims to window and shouts out

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Good morning, is this Lake Pahoe?

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, I don't know about that, but it's bleeding damp. Are you from the council?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No. We are the official British Naval Expedition to this lake. May we come in?

JOHN CLEESE:
Hang on.

DIRECTION:
She submerges and picks up a big sign showing it to the man. The sign reads 'It's not the council, it's a British Naval Expedition to Lake Pahoe or something and can they come in'. The man reads the card. An enormous shark looks over his shoulder appearing from a cupboard. The man sees it and hits it with a newspaper.

ERIC IDLE:
Bloody sharks.

JOHN CLEESE:
Get in.

DIRECTION:
He holds up a sign reading 'Tell them to go away'. The woman swims to the window and gives a V-sign to Sir John.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well um... that would appear to be the end of the expedition.
