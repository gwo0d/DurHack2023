MICHAEL PALIN:
Aren't they marvelous? The strength and boldness... life and power in those colours.

ERIC IDLE:
This must be Titian's masterpiece.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh indeed - if only for the composition alone. The strength of those foreground figures ... the firmness of the line...

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, the confidence of the master at the height of his powers.

TERRY GILLIAM:
Yes?

TERRY JONES:
Hello sonny, your dad in?

TERRY GILLIAM:
Yes.

TERRY JONES:
Could I speak to him please? It's the man from 'The Hay Wain'.

TERRY GILLIAM:
Who?

TERRY JONES:
The man from 'The Hay Wain' by Constable.

TERRY GILLIAM:
Dad... it's the man from 'The Hay Wain' by Constable to see you.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Coming.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Hello? How are you? Come on in.

TERRY JONES:
No, no can't stop, just passing by, actually.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, where are you now?

TERRY JONES:
Well may you ask. We just been moved in next to a room full of Brueghels ... terrible bloody din. Skating all hours of the night. Anyway, I just dropped in to tell you there's been a walk-out in the Impressionists.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Walk-out, eh?

TERRY JONES:
Yeah. It started with the 'DÃ©jeuner Sur L'Herbe' lot, evidently they were moved away from above the radiator or something. Anyway, the Impressionists are all out. Gainsborough's Blue Boy's brought out the eighteenth-century English portraits, the Flemish School's solid, and the German woodcuts are at a meeting now.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Right. Then I'll get the Renaissance School out.

TERRY JONES:
OK, meeting 4.30 - 'Bridge at Arles'.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
OK, cheerio - good luck, son.

TERRY JONES:
OK.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Right - everybody out.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Here is the News...

JOHN CLEESE:
What am I bid for Vermeer's 'Lady Who Used to be at a Window'? Do I hear two bob?

JOHN CLEESE:
Gone. Now what am I bid for another great bargain? Edward Landseer's 'Nothing at Bay'.

MICHAEL PALIN:
All we bloody want is a little bit of bloody consultation.

MICHAEL PALIN:
At a mass meeting at Brentford Football Ground, other works of art voted to come out in support of the paintings.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Meanwhile, at Television Centre work began again on a sketch about Ypres. A spokesman for the sketch said: he fully expected it to be more sensible this time.
