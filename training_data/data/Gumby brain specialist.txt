MICHAEL PALIN:
Doctor! Doctor! DOCTOR!

DIRECTION:
he goes up to the antique desk and bangs the bell violently; he smashes the intercom and generally breaks the desk up

MICHAEL PALIN:
Doctor! Doctor! DOCTOR! DOCTOR! Doctor! Doctor! Where is the Doctor?

DIRECTION:
A pause. Then another door opens and another Gumby appears.

JOHN CLEESE:
Hello!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Are you the brain specialist?

JOHN CLEESE:
No, no, I am not the brain specialist. No, no, I am not... Yes. Yes I am.

MICHAEL PALIN:
My brain hurts!

JOHN CLEESE:
Well let's take a look at it, Mr Gumby.

DIRECTION:
Gumby specialist starts to pull up Gumby's sweater.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, no, no, my brain in my head.

DIRECTION:
specialist thumps him on the head

JOHN CLEESE:
It will have to come out.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Out? Of my head?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes! All the bits of it. Nurse! Nurse!

DIRECTION:
a nurse enters

JOHN CLEESE:
NURSE! NURSE! Nurse, take Mr Gumby to a brain surgeon.

DIRECTION:
Yes doctor...

DIRECTION:
She leads Gumby out. In the background the specialist is grunting and shouting.

JOHN CLEESE:
Where's the 'Lancet'?

DIRECTION:
to T. F. Gumby

DIRECTION:
He's brilliant you know.

JOHN CLEESE:
Where's the bloody 'Lancet'? My brain hurts too.

DIRECTION:
Ambulance racing. 'Dr Kildare' theme. Cut to operating theatre. The surgeon is not a Gumby.

DIRECTION:
putting on Gumby props

DIRECTION:
Gumby voice

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'm going to operate!!

DIRECTION:
We now see he is surrounded by Gumbys. T. F. Gumby is on operating table.

DIRECTION:
Let's operate.

DIRECTION:
They begin to use woodworking implements on T. F. Gumby.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hello!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ooh! We forgot the anaesthetic!

DIRECTION:
The anaesthetic! The anaesthetic!

DIRECTION:
At that moment a Gumby anaesthetist comes crashing through the wall with two gas cylinders.

TERRY JONES:
I've come to anaesthetize you!!

DIRECTION:
He raises a gas cylinder and strikes Gumby hard over the head with it. Bong. Blackness. Into the oblivion of animation.

DIRECTION:
Then cut to an ordinary suburban living room. Mr and Mrs Jalin are sitting on a sofa. The previous item in the show is visible on their TV set. Mrs Jalin is stuffing a chicken. Mr Jalin is reading the telephone directory. The picture changes and we hear voice from TV.

ERIC IDLE:
The 'Nine O'Clock News' which was to follow has been cancelled tonight so we can bring you the quarter finals of the All Essex Badminton Championship. Your commentator as usual is Edna O'Brien.

DIRECTION:
Irish accent

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hullo fans. Begorra an' to be sure there's some fine badminton down there in Essex this afternoon. We really...

DIRECTION:
Mr Jalin picks up a jousting ball and chain and smashes the TV set. There is a ring from the doorbell. Mr Jalin sits, Mrs Jalin goes to the door, exits and comes back.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
George.

TERRY JONES:
Yes, Gladys.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
There's a man at the door with a moustache.

TERRY JONES:
Tell him I've already got one.

DIRECTION:
Mrs Jalin hits him hard with a newspaper

TERRY JONES:
All right, all right. What's he want then?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
He says do we want a documentary on molluscs.

TERRY JONES:
Molluscs?!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes.

TERRY JONES:
What's he mean, molluscs?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
MOLLUSCS!! GASTROPODS! LAMELLIBRANCHS! CEPHALOPODS!

TERRY JONES:
Oh molluscs, I thought you said bacon.

DIRECTION:
she hits him again

TERRY JONES:
All right, all right. What's he charge then?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It's free.

TERRY JONES:
Ooh! Where does he want us to sit?

DIRECTION:
calling through the door

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
He says yes.

DIRECTION:
Mr Zorba enters carrying plywood flat with portion cut out to represent TV. He stands behind flat and starts.

JOHN CLEESE:
Good evening. Tonight molluscs. The mollusc is a soft-bodied, unsegmented invertebrate animal usually protected by a large shell. One of the most numerous groups of invertebrates, it is exceeded in number of species only by the arthropods ... viz.

DIRECTION:
he holds up a lobster

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Not very interesting is it?

JOHN CLEESE:
What?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I was talking to him.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh. Anyway, the typical mollusc, viz, a snail

DIRECTION:
holds one up

JOHN CLEESE:
consists of a prominent muscular portion... the head-foot... a visceral mass and a shell which is secreted by the free edge of the mantle.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Dreadful isn't it?

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh. Well anyway... in some molluscs, however, viz, slugs,

JOHN CLEESE:
the shell is absent or rudimentary...

TERRY JONES:
Switch him off.

DIRECTION:
Mrs Jalin gets up and looks for the switch unsuccessfully.

JOHN CLEESE:
Whereas in others, viz, cephalopods the head-foot is greatly modified and forms tentacles, viz, the squid.

DIRECTION:
looking out

JOHN CLEESE:
What are you doing?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Switching you off.

JOHN CLEESE:
Why, don't you like it?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh it's dreadful.

TERRY JONES:
Embarrassing.

JOHN CLEESE:
Is it?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, it's perfectly awful.

TERRY JONES:
Disgraceful! I don't know how they've got the nerve to put it on.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It's so boring.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well ... it's not much of a subject is it... be fair.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What do you think, George?

TERRY JONES:
Give him another twenty seconds.

JOHN CLEESE:
Anyway the majority of the molluscs are included in three large groups, the gastropods, the lamellibranchs and the cephalopods...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
We knew that

DIRECTION:
she gets up and goes to the set

JOHN CLEESE:
However, what is more interesting, er ... is the molluscs's er ... sex life.

DIRECTION:
stopping dead

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh!

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, the mollusc is a randy little fellow whose primitive brain scarcely strays from the subject of the you know what.

DIRECTION:
going back to sofa

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Disgusting!

TERRY JONES:
Ought not to be allowed.

JOHN CLEESE:
The randiest of the gastropods is the limpet. This hot-blooded little beast with its tent-like shell is always on the job. Its extra-marital activities are something startling. Frankly I don't know how the female limpet finds the time to adhere to the rock-face. How am I doing?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Disgusting.

TERRY JONES:
But more interesting.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh yes, tch, tch, tch.

JOHN CLEESE:
Another loose-living gastropod is the periwinkle. This shameless little libertine with its characteristic ventral locomotion ... is

DIRECTION:
not

JOHN CLEESE:
the marrying kind: 'Anywhere anytime' is its motto. Up with the shell and they're at it.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
How about the lamellibranchs?

JOHN CLEESE:
I'm coming to them ... the great scallop

DIRECTION:
holds up a clam

JOHN CLEESE:
This latter is a right whore, a harlot, a trollop, a cynical bed-hopping firm-breasted Rabelaisian bit of sea food that makes Fanny Hill look like a dead Pope... and finally among the lamellibranch bivalves, that most depraved of the whole sub-species - the whelk. The whelk is nothing but a homosexual of the worst kind. This gay boy of the gastropods, this queer crustacean, this mincing mollusc, this screaming, prancing, limp-wristed queen of the deep makes me sick.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Have you got one?

JOHN CLEESE:
Here!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Let's kill it. Disgusting.

DIRECTION:
Zorba throws it on the floor and Mr and Mrs Jalin stamp on it.

TERRY JONES:
That'll teach it. Well thank you for a very interesting programme.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, not at all. Thank you.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, that was very nice.

JOHN CLEESE:
Thank you.

DIRECTION:
he shakes hands with her

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, thank you.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a studio presenter at a desk.

TERRY GILLIAM:
And now a word from the man in the...

DIRECTION:
Cut to Glencoe vox pop: a loony.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
...street.

DIRECTION:
ANIMATION:

DIRECTION:
high-suction baby.
