MICHAEL PALIN:
Doctor! Doctor! DOCTOR!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Doctor! Doctor! DOCTOR! DOCTOR! Doctor! Doctor! Where is the Doctor?

JOHN CLEESE:
Hello!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Are you the brain specialist?

JOHN CLEESE:
No, no, I am not the brain specialist. No, no, I am not... Yes. Yes I am.

MICHAEL PALIN:
My brain hurts!

JOHN CLEESE:
Well let's take a look at it, Mr Gumby.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, no, no, my brain in my head.

JOHN CLEESE:
It will have to come out.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Out? Of my head?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes! All the bits of it. Nurse! Nurse!

JOHN CLEESE:
NURSE! NURSE! Nurse, take Mr Gumby to a brain surgeon.

JOHN CLEESE:
Where's the 'Lancet'?

JOHN CLEESE:
Where's the bloody 'Lancet'? My brain hurts too.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'm going to operate!!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hello!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ooh! We forgot the anaesthetic!

TERRY JONES:
I've come to anaesthetize you!!

ERIC IDLE:
The 'Nine O'Clock News' which was to follow has been cancelled tonight so we can bring you the quarter finals of the All Essex Badminton Championship. Your commentator as usual is Edna O'Brien.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hullo fans. Begorra an' to be sure there's some fine badminton down there in Essex this afternoon. We really...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
George.

TERRY JONES:
Yes, Gladys.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
There's a man at the door with a moustache.

TERRY JONES:
Tell him I've already got one.

TERRY JONES:
All right, all right. What's he want then?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
He says do we want a documentary on molluscs.

TERRY JONES:
Molluscs?!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes.

TERRY JONES:
What's he mean, molluscs?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
MOLLUSCS!! GASTROPODS! LAMELLIBRANCHS! CEPHALOPODS!

TERRY JONES:
Oh molluscs, I thought you said bacon.

TERRY JONES:
All right, all right. What's he charge then?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It's free.

TERRY JONES:
Ooh! Where does he want us to sit?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
He says yes.

JOHN CLEESE:
Good evening. Tonight molluscs. The mollusc is a soft-bodied, unsegmented invertebrate animal usually protected by a large shell. One of the most numerous groups of invertebrates, it is exceeded in number of species only by the arthropods ... viz.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Not very interesting is it?

JOHN CLEESE:
What?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I was talking to him.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh. Anyway, the typical mollusc, viz, a snail

JOHN CLEESE:
consists of a prominent muscular portion... the head-foot... a visceral mass and a shell which is secreted by the free edge of the mantle.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Dreadful isn't it?

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh. Well anyway... in some molluscs, however, viz, slugs,

JOHN CLEESE:
the shell is absent or rudimentary...

TERRY JONES:
Switch him off.

JOHN CLEESE:
Whereas in others, viz, cephalopods the head-foot is greatly modified and forms tentacles, viz, the squid.

JOHN CLEESE:
What are you doing?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Switching you off.

JOHN CLEESE:
Why, don't you like it?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh it's dreadful.

TERRY JONES:
Embarrassing.

JOHN CLEESE:
Is it?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, it's perfectly awful.

TERRY JONES:
Disgraceful! I don't know how they've got the nerve to put it on.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It's so boring.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well ... it's not much of a subject is it... be fair.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What do you think, George?

TERRY JONES:
Give him another twenty seconds.

JOHN CLEESE:
Anyway the majority of the molluscs are included in three large groups, the gastropods, the lamellibranchs and the cephalopods...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
We knew that

JOHN CLEESE:
However, what is more interesting, er ... is the molluscs's er ... sex life.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh!

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, the mollusc is a randy little fellow whose primitive brain scarcely strays from the subject of the you know what.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Disgusting!

TERRY JONES:
Ought not to be allowed.

JOHN CLEESE:
The randiest of the gastropods is the limpet. This hot-blooded little beast with its tent-like shell is always on the job. Its extra-marital activities are something startling. Frankly I don't know how the female limpet finds the time to adhere to the rock-face. How am I doing?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Disgusting.

TERRY JONES:
But more interesting.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh yes, tch, tch, tch.

JOHN CLEESE:
Another loose-living gastropod is the periwinkle. This shameless little libertine with its characteristic ventral locomotion ... is

JOHN CLEESE:
the marrying kind: 'Anywhere anytime' is its motto. Up with the shell and they're at it.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
How about the lamellibranchs?

JOHN CLEESE:
I'm coming to them ... the great scallop

JOHN CLEESE:
This latter is a right whore, a harlot, a trollop, a cynical bed-hopping firm-breasted Rabelaisian bit of sea food that makes Fanny Hill look like a dead Pope... and finally among the lamellibranch bivalves, that most depraved of the whole sub-species - the whelk. The whelk is nothing but a homosexual of the worst kind. This gay boy of the gastropods, this queer crustacean, this mincing mollusc, this screaming, prancing, limp-wristed queen of the deep makes me sick.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Have you got one?

JOHN CLEESE:
Here!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Let's kill it. Disgusting.

TERRY JONES:
That'll teach it. Well thank you for a very interesting programme.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, not at all. Thank you.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, that was very nice.

JOHN CLEESE:
Thank you.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, thank you.

TERRY GILLIAM:
And now a word from the man in the...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
...street.
