MICHAEL PALIN:
Good doctor morning! Nice year for the time of day!

JOHN CLEESE:
Come in.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Can I down sit?

JOHN CLEESE:
Certainly.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, then?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, now, not going to bush the doctor about the beat too long. I'm going to come to point the straight immediately.

JOHN CLEESE:
Good, good.

MICHAEL PALIN:
My particular prob, or buglem bear, I've had ages. For years, I've had it for donkeys.

JOHN CLEESE:
What?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'm up to here with it, I'm sick to death. I can't take you any longer so I've come to see it.

JOHN CLEESE:
Ah, now this is your problem with words.

MICHAEL PALIN:
This is my problem with words. Oh, that seems to have cleared it. 'Oh I come from Alabama with my banjo on my knee'. Yes, that seems to be all right. Thank you very much.

JOHN CLEESE:
I see. But recently you have been having this problem with your word order.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, absolutely, and what makes it worse, sometimes at the end of a sentence I'll come out with the wrong fusebox.

JOHN CLEESE:
Fusebox?

MICHAEL PALIN:
And the thing about saying the wrong word is a) I don't notice it, and b) sometimes orange water given bucket of plaster.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, tell me more about your problem.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well as I say, you'd just be talking and out'll pudenda the wrong word and ashtray's your uncle. So I'm really strawberry about it.

JOHN CLEESE:
Upset?

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's so embarrassing when my wife and I go to an orgy.

JOHN CLEESE:
A party?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, an orgy. We live in Esher.

JOHN CLEESE:
Quite.

MICHAEL PALIN:
That's what I said. Such a bloody whack the diddle fa di la, fo di la, lo do di ... do di do, rum fum.

JOHN CLEESE:
Mr Burrows, this is no common problem. You are suffering from a disease so rare that it hasn't got a name. Not yet. But it will have. Oh yes. This is the opportunity I've been waiting for. The chance of a lifetime!

JOHN CLEESE:
I'll show them at the Royal College of Surgeons! I'll make them sit up and take notice! Thripshaw's disease! Discovered by E. Henry Thripshaw MD! I'll be invited on 'Call My Bluff' and the merchandizing, there'll be E. Henry Thripshaw t-shirts ... I'll turn it into a game ... I'll sell the film rights.
