TERRY JONES:
Oh dad... look who's come to see us... it's our Ken.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Aye, and about bloody time if you ask me.

ERIC IDLE:
Aren't you pleased to see me, father?

TERRY JONES:
Of course he's pleased to see you, Ken, he...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
All right, woman, all right I've got a tongue in my head - I'll do 'talkin'.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Aye ... I like yer fancy suit. Is that what they're wearing up in Yorkshire now?

ERIC IDLE:
It's just an ordinary suit, father... it's all I've got apart from the overalls.

TERRY JONES:
How are you liking it down the mine, Ken?

ERIC IDLE:
Oh it's not too bad, mum... we're using some new tungsten carbide drills for the      preliminary coal-face scouring operations.

TERRY JONES:
Oh that sounds nice, dear...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Tungsten carbide drills! What the bloody hell's tungsten carbide drills?

ERIC IDLE:
It's something they use in coal-mining, father.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
'It's something they use in coal-mining, father'. You're all bloody fancy talk since you left London.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh not that again.

TERRY JONES:
He's had a hard day dear... his new play opens at the National Theatre tomorrow.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh that's good.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Good!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What do you know about it? What do you know about getting up at five      o'clock in t'morning to fly to Paris... back at the Old Vic for drinks at twelve, sweating the day      through press interviews, television interviews and getting back here at ten to wrestle with the      problem of a homosexual nymphomaniac drug-addict involved in the ritual murder of a well      known Scottish footballer. That's a full working day, lad, and don't you forget it!

TERRY JONES:
Oh, don't shout at the boy, father.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Aye, 'ampstead wasn't good enough for you, was it? ... you had to go poncing off to      Barnsley, you and yer coal-mining friends.

ERIC IDLE:
Coal-mining is a wonderful thing father, but it's something you'll never understand. Just      look at you!

TERRY JONES:
Oh Ken! Be careful! You know what he's like after a few novels.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh come on lad! Come on, out wi' it! What's wrong wi' me?... yet

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
!

ERIC IDLE:
I'll tell you what's wrong with you. Your head's addled with novels and poems, you come      home every evening reeling of Chateau La Tour...

TERRY JONES:
Oh don't, don't.

ERIC IDLE:
And look what you've done to mother! She's worn out with meeting film stars, attending      premieres and giving gala luncheons...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
There's nowt wrong wi' gala luncheons, lad! I've had more gala luncheons than you've      had hot dinners!

TERRY JONES:
Oh please!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Aaaaaaagh!

TERRY JONES:
Oh no!

ERIC IDLE:
What is it?

TERRY JONES:
Oh, it's his writer's cramp!

ERIC IDLE:
You never told me about this...

TERRY JONES:
No, we didn't like to, Kenny.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'm all right! I'm all right, woman. Just get him out of here.

TERRY JONES:
Oh Ken! You'd better go ...

ERIC IDLE:
All right. I'm going.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
After all we've done for him...

ERIC IDLE:
One day you'll realize there's more to life than culture... There's dirt, and smoke, and good honest sweat!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Get out! Get out! Get OUT! You ... LABOURER!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Hey, you know, mother, I think there's a play there .... get t'agent on t'phone.

TERRY JONES:
Aye I think you're right, Frank, it could express, it could express a vital theme of our      age...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Aye.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh shut up!

MICHAEL PALIN:
And now for something completely different ... a man with three buttocks...

TERRY JONES:
We've done that!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh all right. All right! A man with nine legs.

JOHN CLEESE:
He ran away.
