TERRY JONES:
Morning, Squadron Leader.

ERIC IDLE:
What-ho, Squiffy.

TERRY JONES:
How was it?

ERIC IDLE:
Top-hole. Bally Jerry, pranged his kite right in the how's your father. Hairy blighter, dicky-birdied, feathered back on his Sammy, took a waspy, flipped over on his Betty Harper's and caught his can in the Bertie.

TERRY JONES:
Er, I'm afraid I don't quite follow you, Squadron Leader.

ERIC IDLE:
It's perfectly ordinary banter, Squiffy. Bally Jerry...pranged his kite right in the how's yer father...hairy blighter, dicky-birdied, feathered back on his Sammy, took a waspy, flipped over on his Betty Harper's and caught his can in the Bertie.

TERRY JONES:
No, I'm just not understanding banter at all well today. Give us it slower.

ERIC IDLE:
Banter's not the

ERIC IDLE:
if you say it slower, Squiffy.

TERRY JONES:
Hold on then.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes!

TERRY JONES:
Bend an ear to the Squadron Leader's banter for a sec, would you?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Can do.

TERRY JONES:
Jolly good.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Fire away.

ERIC IDLE:

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
...No, don't understand that banter at all.

ERIC IDLE:
Something up with my banter, chaps?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Bunch of monkeys on the ceiling, sir! Grab your egg and fours and let's get the bacon delivered!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Do you understand that?

ERIC IDLE:
No, didn't get a word of it.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Sorry old man, we don't understand your banter.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You know...bally ten-penny ones dropping in the custard...

MICHAEL PALIN:
un...Charlie Choppers chucking a handful...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no...sorry.

TERRY JONES:
Say it a bit slower, old chap.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Slower

MICHAEL PALIN:
, sir?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ra-ther!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Um...sausage squad up the blue end?

ERIC IDLE:
No, still don't get it.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Um...cabbage crates coming over the briny?

ERIC IDLE:
No.

ERIC IDLE:
But by then it was too late. The first cabbage crates hit London on July the 7th. That was just the beginning.
