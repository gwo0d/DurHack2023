GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, if you'll just wait in here, sir, I'm sure Mr Thompson won't keep you waiting long.

ERIC IDLE:
Fine. Thanks very much.

ERIC IDLE:
The mirror fell off the wall.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Sir?

ERIC IDLE:
The mirror fell off... off the wall... it fell.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I see. You'd better wait here. I'll get a cloth.

ERIC IDLE:
Ah, it ... it came off the wall.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, sir?

ERIC IDLE:
It just came right off the wall.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Really, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, I ... I didn't touch it.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Of course not. It just fell off the wall.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes. It just fell off the wall.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Don't move. I'll get help.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes - er, fell off the wall.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh my God, what a mess. 'Ere, did you do this?

ERIC IDLE:
No, no. I didn't do all this. It... it did it all.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh? Well... 'ere, hold this. I'll get started.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, it's jolly nice. What is it?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
It's a Brazilian dagger. Ooops.

ERIC IDLE:
Er, she just fell on ... on to the dagger.

TERRY JONES:
Yes, of course she did, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, just gave me the dagger and tripped, and went, 'Oops'.

TERRY JONES:
Yes sir, I understand.

ERIC IDLE:
I mean, I didn't er...

TERRY JONES:
Oh no, no, of course not, sir, I understand.

ERIC IDLE:
I mean she ... she just, er...

TERRY JONES:
Fell?

ERIC IDLE:
Fell.

TERRY JONES:
Arrghh!

ERIC IDLE:
I'm terribly sorry.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
That's him.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
Hello, officer. There seems to have been an accident. Well, several accidents actually.

MICHAEL PALIN:
That's right, sir. Would you come this way, please.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You swine. I'll get you for that.

ERIC IDLE:
Er, I won't wait. I'll phone.

ERIC IDLE:
Sorry.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, Mr Belpit. Your legs are so swollen.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Excuse me, is that the school hall?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Um, I'm sorry, I don't know. I'm not in this one - I'm in next week's, I think.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, come on.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, Mr Belpit!...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, here we are.

JOHN CLEESE:
Ah well, they seem to have linked that themselves, so there's no need for me to interrupt at all. So, ah, back to the school hall.
