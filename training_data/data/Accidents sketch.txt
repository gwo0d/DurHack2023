GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, if you'll just wait in here, sir, I'm sure Mr Thompson won't keep you waiting long.

ERIC IDLE:
Fine. Thanks very much.

DIRECTION:
He picks up a magazine. The mirror behind him without warning falls off the wall and smashes to the ground. The butler returns, and looks at the man enquiringly.

ERIC IDLE:
The mirror fell off the wall.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Sir?

ERIC IDLE:
The mirror fell off... off the wall... it fell.

DIRECTION:
disbelieving but polite

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I see. You'd better wait here. I'll get a cloth.

DIRECTION:
The butler just closes the door behind him and the bookcase detaches itself from the wall and comes sweeping down, bringing with it the drinks trolley. The butler opens the door.

ERIC IDLE:
Ah, it ... it came off the wall.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, sir?

ERIC IDLE:
It just came right off the wall.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Really, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, I ... I didn't touch it.

DIRECTION:
politely ironic

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Of course not. It just fell off the wall.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes. It just fell off the wall.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Don't move. I'll get help.

DIRECTION:
He goes.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes - er, fell off the wall.

DIRECTION:
A maid enters.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh my God, what a mess. 'Ere, did you do this?

ERIC IDLE:
No, no. I didn't do all this. It... it did it all.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh? Well... 'ere, hold this. I'll get started.

DIRECTION:
She hands him a dagger.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, it's jolly nice. What is it?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
It's a Brazilian dagger. Ooops.

DIRECTION:
She trips, falls lethally on to the dagger he is holding. She collapses at his feet. There is blood on the dagger and his hand. He is looking down at her, when he becomes aware of a man in a green baize apron at the door, who is looking at him in horror.

ERIC IDLE:
Er, she just fell on ... on to the dagger.

DIRECTION:
soothingly

TERRY JONES:
Yes, of course she did, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, just gave me the dagger and tripped, and went, 'Oops'.

DIRECTION:
Green starts backing round the room away from him, but humouring him.

TERRY JONES:
Yes sir, I understand.

ERIC IDLE:
I mean, I didn't er...

TERRY JONES:
Oh no, no, of course not, sir, I understand.

ERIC IDLE:
I mean she ... she just, er...

TERRY JONES:
Fell?

ERIC IDLE:
Fell.

DIRECTION:
backs off too far and falls backwards through the window

TERRY JONES:
Arrghh!

DIRECTION:
to window

ERIC IDLE:
I'm terribly sorry.

DIRECTION:
A policeman and the butler appear at the door.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
That's him.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
Hello, officer. There seems to have been an accident. Well, several accidents actually.

MICHAEL PALIN:
That's right, sir. Would you come this way, please.

DIRECTION:
goes towards him

DIRECTION:
clutches chest

DIRECTION:
collapses

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You swine. I'll get you for that.

DIRECTION:
He is about to move forward when a large portion of the ceiling collapses on him. He goes down, too.

ERIC IDLE:
Er, I won't wait. I'll phone.

DIRECTION:
He moves off through door. Large crashing sounds. He comes downstairs into a stretch of hall leading to an outside door. As he comes suits of armour collapse, bookcase glass smashes, a grandfather clock tips over and smashes, pictures fall off walls. All this quite quickly in sequence as he passes in horror. He gets to the main door. We see his relief. He closes the main door behind him, slamming it: it's a country-house-type entrance. Cut to stock film of country house being blown up. Cut back to man looking in horror, with dust and rubble swirling around. He is holding the remains of the door.

ERIC IDLE:
Sorry.

DIRECTION:
Pull wide. He is in a patch of rubble. The Society for Putting Things on Top of Other Things members walk by in their evening dress.

DIRECTION:
I think we're really out this time. Yes. Jolly good. Now where's the school hall. I think it's over there. Come on. Sorry. Jolly good.

DIRECTION:
They go past the bishop in the field.

DIRECTION:
singing

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, Mr Belpit. Your legs are so swollen.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Excuse me, is that the school hall?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Um, I'm sorry, I don't know. I'm not in this one - I'm in next week's, I think.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, come on.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, Mr Belpit!...

DIRECTION:
They come to a school hall. A sign says 'Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, presented by the staff and pupils of the Dibley School for Boys'.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, here we are.

DIRECTION:
they go in

DIRECTION:
Cut to linkman in cafeteria.

JOHN CLEESE:
Ah well, they seem to have linked that themselves, so there's no need for me to interrupt at all. So, ah, back to the school hall.
