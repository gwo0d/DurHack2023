ERIC IDLE:
Dear Sir, I wish to protest in the strongest possible terms. Yours sincerely, Brigadier N. F. Marwood-Git (retired). Read that back, will you, Brian.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And when he had built up Cedron, he sent Horsemen there, and an host of footmen to the end that issuing out they might make outroads upon the ways of Judea, as the King commanded them...

ERIC IDLE:
Good! Pop it in an envelope and bung it off! It's no good bottling these things up, Brian. If you feel them you must say them or you'll just go mad...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh yes indeed ... as the book of Maccabee said ... Ye as the flea is like unto an oxen, so is the privet hedge liken unto a botanist black in thy sight, O Lord!

ERIC IDLE:
Quite... Look why don't you just nip out for lunch, Brian...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yea ... as Raymond Chandler said, it was one of those days when Los Angeles felt like a rock-hard fig.

ERIC IDLE:
Brian, let's stop this pretending, shall we.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh... ye... as Dirk Bogarde said in his autobiography...

ERIC IDLE:
Brian... let's stop all this futile pretence... I've... I've always been moderately fond of you...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well to be quite frank, Brigadier ... one can't walk so closely with a chap like you for... for so long without... feeling something deep down inside, even if it isn't anything... anything ... very much.

ERIC IDLE:
Well, splendid... Brian... er... well I don't suppose there's much we can do, really.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Not on television ... no...

ERIC IDLE:
No... they ... they are a lot more permissive these days than they used to be...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah yes... but not with this sort of thing...

ERIC IDLE:
No ... I suppose they've ... got to draw the line somewhere...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes...

ERIC IDLE:
Well take a letter, Brian. Dear Sir, I wish to protest...
