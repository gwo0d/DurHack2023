ERIC IDLE:
Who, a year ago, had heard of Mr and Mrs Brian Norris of 37, Gledhill Gardens, Parsons Green? And yet their epic journey in EBW 343 has set them alongside Thor Heyerdahl and Sir Edmund Hillary. Starting only with a theory, Mr Norris set out to prove that the inhabitants of Hounslow could have been descendants of the people of Surbiton who had made the great trek north. No newcomer to this field, Mr Norris's 'A Short History of Motor Traffic Between Purley and Esher' had become a best-selling minor classic in the car-swapping belt.

ERIC IDLE:
and thirdly, the similarity of speech.

TERRY JONES:
Are you still running the GDBDMDB?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, but I've had the excess nipples woppled to remove tamping.

TERRY JONES:
Jolly good.

ERIC IDLE:
Were these just coincidences, or were they, as Mr Norris believed, part of an identical cultural background? One further discovery convinced him.

ERIC IDLE:
The lawnmower. Surely such a sophisticated household gadget could not have been generated independently in two separate areas. Mr Norris was convinced.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'm convinced.

ERIC IDLE:
But how to prove it.

MICHAEL PALIN:
But how to prove it.

ERIC IDLE:
There was only one way to see if the journey between Surbiton and Hounslow was possible, and that was to try and make it. Months of preparation followed whilst Mr Norris continued his research in the Putney Public Library,

and Mrs Norris made sandwiches.

ERIC IDLE:
Finally, by April, they were ready. On the 23rd, Mr and Mrs Norris set out from 'Abide-A-Wee' to motor the fifteen miles to Surbiton, watched by a crowd of local well-wishers.

ERIC IDLE:
This would be the last they'd see of civilization. Mr Norris's diary for the 23rd reveals the extraordinary calmness and deep inner peacefulness of his mind.

MICHAEL PALIN:
7.30 Fed cat.

ERIC IDLE:
On the morning of the 24th, early to avoid the traffic, Mr Norris's historic expedition set out from Surbiton - destination Hounslow. Early on they began to perceive encouraging signs.

ERIC IDLE:
'Wrong Way' Norris had accidentally stumbled on a piece of anthropological history. It was the inhabitants of Hounslow who had made the great trek south to the sunnier pastures of Surbiton, and not vice versa, as he had originally surmised. This was the secret of Surbiton! Happy and contented Mr Norris returned to the calmer waters of chartered accountancy, for, in his way, 'Wrong Way' Norris was right.

JOHN CLEESE:
And now...

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's...
