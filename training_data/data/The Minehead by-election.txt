ERIC IDLE:
Like what?

TERRY JONES:
Well, for a start he wants to annex Poland.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, North Minehead's Conservative, isn't it?

TERRY JONES:
Well, they get a lot of people at their rallies.

ERIC IDLE:
Rallies?

TERRY JONES:
Well, their Bocalist meetings, down at the Axis Café in Rosedale Road.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a grotty Italian café. Sign above it read 'Axis Café, Italian Food a Specialty'. A figure clearly belonging to Mussolini is nailing up a sign or poster which reads: 'Vote for Hitler'. He looks around and goes into the café furtively. At this moment past the café come Hitler, Von Ribbentrop and Himmler on bikes. Hitler at the front shouting German through a megaphone. Von Ribbentrop at the back with a large banner 'Hilter for a better Meinhead'. Himmler in the middle with an old grammophone playing 'Deutschland Über Alles'.

DIRECTION:
Cut to Hitler ranting in German on a balcony with Himmler at his side. Beneath them is a Nazi flag.

JOHN CLEESE:
I am not a racialist, but, und this is a big but, we in the National Bocialist Party believe das Überleben muss gestammen sein mit der schneaky Armstrong-Jones. Historische Taunton ist Volkermeinig von Meinhead.

DIRECTION:
stepping forward

DIRECTION:
Hilter

MICHAEL PALIN:
, he says that historically Taunton is a part of Minehead already.

DIRECTION:
Shot of a yokel looking disbelievingly at balcony. Von Ribbentrop appears behind.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
He's right, do you know that?

DIRECTION:
Meanwhile back on the balcony.

DIRECTION:
very exited

JOHN CLEESE:
Und Bridgwater ist die letzte Fühlung das wir haben in Somerset!

DIRECTION:
Over this we hear loud applause and 'Sieg Heils'. The yokel, who is not applauding, turns round rather surprised to see whence cometh the applause. He sees Von Ribbentrop operating a grammophone.

DIRECTION:
Cut to vox pops.

DIRECTION:
voice over

JOHN CLEESE:
What do you think of Mr Hilter's politics.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I don't like the sound of these 'ere boncentration bamps.

ERIC IDLE:
Well, I gave him my baby to kiss and he bit it on the head.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, I think he'd do a lot of good to the Stock Exchange.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No...no...

DIRECTION:
thinly disguised as yokel

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh yes Britischer pals he is wunderbar...ful. So.

TERRY JONES:
I think he's right about the coons, but then I'm a bit mental.

TERRY JONES:
I think he's got beautiful legs!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well speaking as Conservative candidate I just drone on and on and on...never letting anyone else get a word in edgeways, until I start foaming at the mouth and fall over backwards.

DIRECTION:
he foams at the mouth and falls over backwards

DIRECTION:
Cut to 'Spectrum' studio: same presenter as before, sitting at desk.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Foam at the mouth and fall over backwards. Is he foaming at the mouth to fall over backwards or falling over backwards to foam at the mouth. Tonight 'Spectrum' examines the whole question of frothing and falling, coughing and calling, screaming and bawling, walling and stalling, galling and mauling, palling and hauling, trawling and squalling and zalling. Zalling? Is there a word zalling? If there is what does it mean...if there isn't what does it mean? Perhaps both. Maybe neither. What do I mean by the word mean? What do I mean by the word word, what do I mean by what do I mean, what do I mean by do, and what do I do by mean? What do I do by do by do and what do I do by wasting your time like this? Goodnight.
