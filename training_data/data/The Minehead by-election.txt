TERRY JONES:
Well it's the North Minehead bye-election. Mr Hilter's standing as the National Bocialist candidate. He's got wonderful plans for Minehead.

ERIC IDLE:
Like what?

TERRY JONES:
Well, for a start he wants to annex Poland.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, North Minehead's Conservative, isn't it?

TERRY JONES:
Well, they get a lot of people at their rallies.

ERIC IDLE:
Rallies?

TERRY JONES:
Well, their Bocalist meetings, down at the Axis Café in Rosedale Road.

JOHN CLEESE:
I am not a racialist, but, und this is a big but, we in the National Bocialist Party believe das Überleben muss gestammen sein mit der schneaky Armstrong-Jones. Historische Taunton ist Volkermeinig von Meinhead.

MICHAEL PALIN:
, he says that historically Taunton is a part of Minehead already.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
He's right, do you know that?

JOHN CLEESE:
Und Bridgwater ist die letzte Fühlung das wir haben in Somerset!

JOHN CLEESE:
What do you think of Mr Hilter's politics.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I don't like the sound of these 'ere boncentration bamps.

ERIC IDLE:
Well, I gave him my baby to kiss and he bit it on the head.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, I think he'd do a lot of good to the Stock Exchange.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No...no...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh yes Britischer pals he is wunderbar...ful. So.

TERRY JONES:
I think he's right about the coons, but then I'm a bit mental.

TERRY JONES:
I think he's got beautiful legs!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well speaking as Conservative candidate I just drone on and on and on...never letting anyone else get a word in edgeways, until I start foaming at the mouth and fall over backwards.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Foam at the mouth and fall over backwards. Is he foaming at the mouth to fall over backwards or falling over backwards to foam at the mouth. Tonight 'Spectrum' examines the whole question of frothing and falling, coughing and calling, screaming and bawling, walling and stalling, galling and mauling, palling and hauling, trawling and squalling and zalling. Zalling? Is there a word zalling? If there is what does it mean...if there isn't what does it mean? Perhaps both. Maybe neither. What do I mean by the word mean? What do I mean by the word word, what do I mean by what do I mean, what do I mean by do, and what do I do by mean? What do I do by do by do and what do I do by wasting your time like this? Goodnight.
