GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ah, John. Allow me to introduce my next-door neighbour. John Stokes, this is A Snivelling Little Rat-Faced Git. Ah!

TERRY JONES:
Hello, I noticed a slight look of anxiety cross your face for a moment just then, but you needn't worry - I'm used to it. That's the trouble of having a surname like Git.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh ... yes, yes.

TERRY JONES:
We did think once of having it changed by deed-poll, you know - to Watson or something like that. But A Snivelling Little Rat-Faced Watson's just as bad eh?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, yes, I suppose so.

DIRECTION:
Mrs Git approaches.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, that's my wife. Darling! Come and meet Mr... what was it?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Stokes - John Stokes.

TERRY JONES:
Oh yes. John Stokes, this is my wife, Dreary Fat Boring Old.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, er, how do you do.

JOHN CLEESE:
How do

DIRECTION:
you

JOHN CLEESE:
do.

DIRECTION:
Mrs Stokes appears.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Darling, there you are!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, yes, here I am, yes.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, is this your wife?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, yes, yes, this is the wife. Yes. Um darling, these, these are the Gits.

DIRECTION:
slightly shocked

CAROL CLEVELAND:
What?

MICHAEL PALIN:
The Gits.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, heaven's sakes we are being formal. Does it have to be surnames?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, no, no. Not at all. No. Um, no, this... this... this is my wife Norah, er, Norah Jane, Norah Jane Stokes. This is Snivelling Little Rat-Faced Git. And this is his wife Dreary Fat Boring Old Git.

TERRY JONES:
I was just telling your husband what an awful bore it is having a surname like Git.

DIRECTION:
understanding at last

CAROL CLEVELAND:
OH Oh well, it's not that bad.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, you've no idea how the kids get taunted. Why, only last week Dirty Lying Little Two-Faced came running home from school, sobbing his eyes out, and our youngest, Ghastly Spotty Horrible Vicious Little is just at the age when taunts like 'she's a git' really hurt. Yes.

DIRECTION:
Mrs Git gobs colourfully into her handbag.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Do ... do you live round here?

TERRY JONES:
Yes, we live up the road, number 49 - you can't miss it. We've just had the outside painted with warm pus.

DIRECTION:
with increasing embarrassment

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh.

TERRY JONES:
Yes. It's very nice actually. It goes nicely with the vomit and catarrh we've got smeared all over the front door.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
I think we ought to be going. We have two children to collect.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, well, bring them round for tea tomorrow.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Well...

TERRY JONES:
It's Ghastly Spotty Cross-Eyed's birthday and she's having a disembowelling party for a few friends. The Nauseas will be there, and Doug and Janice Mucus, and the Rectums from Swanage.

DIRECTION:
and CAPTION:

DIRECTION:
'AND NOW A NICE VERSION OF THAT SAME SKETCH'

DIRECTION:
Cut to exactly the same set-up as before.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
John! Allow me to introduce our next-door neighhour. John, this is Mr Watson.

TERRY JONES:
Hello. I noticed a slight look of anxiety cross your face just then but you needn't worry.

DIRECTION:
Cut to nun.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
I preferred the dirty version.

DIRECTION:
She is knocked out by the boxer.

DIRECTION:
Cut to Women's Institute applause film.
