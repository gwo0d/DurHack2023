JOHN CLEESE:
For Mrs Emma Hamilton of Nelson, a Scotsman on a horse.

DIRECTION:
A Scotsman (John) rides up to the camera and looks around puzzled. In long-shot we see him riding off. At a wee Scottish kirk another Scotsman (Michael) is waiting at the head of the aisle to be married. Intercut between first Scotsman galloping through the countryside and the wedding procession coming up the aisle. The wedding takes place; just as it finishes the first Scotsman rides up to the kirk and rushes in. The assembled congregation look at him in alarm as he surveys them; then he picks up Michael and carries him off. Cut to film of Women's Institute audience applauding.
