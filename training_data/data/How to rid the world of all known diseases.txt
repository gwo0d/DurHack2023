DIRECTION:
Cut to a sign saying 'How to do it'. Music. Pull out to reveal a 'Blue Peter' type set. Sitting casually on the edge of a dais are three presenters in sweaters - Noel, Jackie and Alan - plus a large bloodhound.

JOHN CLEESE:
Hello.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Hello.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, last week we showed you how to become a gynaecologist. And this week on 'How to do it' we're going to show you how to play the flute, how to split an atom, how to construct a box girder bridge, how to irrigate the Sahara Desert and make vast new areas of land cultivatable, but first, here's Jackie to tell you all how to rid the world of all known diseases.

ERIC IDLE:
Hello, Alan.

JOHN CLEESE:
Hello, Jackie.

ERIC IDLE:
Well, first of all become a doctor and discover a marvellous cure for something, and then, when the medical profession really starts to take notice of you, you can jolly well tell them what to do and make sure they get everything right so there'll never be any diseases ever again.

JOHN CLEESE:
Thanks, Jackie. Great idea. How to play the flute.

DIRECTION:
picking up a flute

JOHN CLEESE:
Well here we are. You blow there and you move your fingers up and down here.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Great, great, Alan. Well, next week we'll be showing you how black and white people can live together in peace and harmony, and Alan will be over in Moscow showing us how to reconcile the Russians and the Chinese. So, until next week, cheerio.

JOHN CLEESE:
Bye.

ERIC IDLE:
Bye.
