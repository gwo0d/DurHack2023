TERRY JONES:
Morning, sir, can I help you?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, yes... I wondered if you have any part-time vacancies on your books.

TERRY JONES:
Part-time, I'll have a look, sir.

TERRY JONES:
Let me look now. We've got, ah yes, Sir Walter Raleigh is equipping another expedition to Virginia; he needs traders and sailors. Vittlers needed at the Court of Philip of Spain, oh, yes, and they want master joiners and craftsmen for the building of the Globe Theatre.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I see. Have you anything a bit more modern, you know, like a job on the buses, or digging the underground?

TERRY JONES:
Oh no, we only have Tudor jobs.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
That can't be very profitable, can it?

TERRY JONES:
Well, you'd be surprised, actually sir. The Tudor economy's booming, ever since Sir Humphrey Gilbert opened up the Northwest passage to Cathay, and the Cabots' expansion in Canada, there's been a tremendous surge in exports, and trade with the Holy Roman Empire is going... no, quite right, it's no good at all.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What?

TERRY JONES:
It's a dead loss. We haven't put anyone in a job since 1625.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I see.

TERRY JONES:
That's all?

TERRY JONES:
That's all you say?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes.

TERRY JONES:
No, no, we were the tops then. Drake got all his sailors here. Elizabeth, we supplied the archbishops for her coronation. Shakespeare started off from here as a temp. Then came James the First and the bottom fell out of the Tudor jobs. 1603 - 800 vacancies filled, 1604 - 40, 1605 - none, 1606 - none. The rest of the Stuart period nothing. Hanoverians nothing. Victorians nothing. Saxe-Coburgs nothing. Windsors... what did you want?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Dirty books, please.

TERRY JONES:
Right.

TERRY JONES:
Sorry about the Tudor bit, but you can't be too careful, you know. Have a look through these.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Have you got anything a bit... er...

TERRY JONES:
A bit stronger?

TERRY JONES:
Hold on ... a... My Lord of Warwick!

ERIC IDLE:
'Allo!

TERRY JONES:
Raise high the drawbridge. Gloucester's troops approach.

ERIC IDLE:
Right.

TERRY JONES:
Can't be too careful you know, sir.
