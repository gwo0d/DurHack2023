MICHAEL PALIN:
'Oh Mr Belpit your legs are so swollen' ...

MICHAEL PALIN:
'Oh Mr Belpit., .'

TERRY JONES:
Excuse me, excuse me. I saw your advertisement for flying lessons and I'd like to make an application.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Nothing to do with me. I'm not in this show.

TERRY JONES:
Oh I see. D'you ... d'you., . do you know about the flying lessons?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Nothing to do with me. I'm not in this show. This is show five - I'm not in until show eight.

TERRY JONES:
Oh I see.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'm just learning my lines, you know. 'Oh Mr Belpit, your legs...'

TERRY JONES:
Bit awkward, I'm a bit stuck.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, well. Try over there.

TERRY JONES:
Oh yes, thanks. Thanks a lot.

MICHAEL PALIN:
'Oh Mr Belpit' - not at all - 'your legs are so swollen'.

TERRY JONES:
Excuse me, I saw your advertisement for flying lessons and I'd like to make an application.

CAROL CLEVELAND:

TERRY JONES:
Yes, yes.

CAROL CLEVELAND:

CAROL CLEVELAND:

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh, be careful.

TERRY JONES:
Yes, nearly tripped.

CAROL CLEVELAND:

TERRY JONES:
Good. It's a long way, isn't it?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh, get hold of that - watch it.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Morning. Upstairs. Be careful, it's very steep. Almost there.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Morning.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
In here, please.

TERRY JONES:
Thank you.

TERRY JONES:
Hello, I saw your advertisement for flying lessons and I'd like to make an appointment.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ah, won't be a moment. Make yourself at home.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Missed. Now Mr er...

TERRY JONES:
Chigger.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Mr Chigger. So, you want to learn to fly?

TERRY JONES:
Yes.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Right, well, up on the table, arms out, fingers together, knees bent...

TERRY JONES:
No, no, no.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Rotten. Rotten. You're no bloody use at all. You're an utter bloody wash-out. You make me sick, you weed!

TERRY JONES:
Now look here...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
All right, all right. I'll give you one more chance, get on the table...

TERRY JONES:
Look, I came here to learn how to fly an aeroplane.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
A what?

TERRY JONES:
I came here to learn how to fly an aeroplane.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
'Oh, oh, no more buttered scones for me, mater. I'm off to play the grand piano'. 'Pardon me while I fly my aeroplane.' Now get on the table!

TERRY JONES:
Look. No one in the history of the world has ever been able to fly like that.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, I suppose mater told you that while you were out riding. Well, if people can't fly what am I doing up here?

TERRY JONES:
You're on a wire.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, a wire. I'm on a wire, am I?

TERRY JONES:
Of course you're on a bloody wire.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I am

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
on a wire. I am flying.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I am flying.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'll show you whether I'm on a wire or not. Give me the 'oop.

TERRY JONES:
What?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, I don't suppose we know what an 'oop is. I suppose pater thought they were a bit common, except on the bleedin' croquet lawn.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, a

TERRY JONES:
.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
'Oh an

TERRY JONES:
Go on, right the way along.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
All right, all right, all right.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
. Now, where's the bleeding wire, then?

TERRY JONES:
That hoop's got a hole in.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh Eton and Madgalene. The hoop has an hole in. Of course it's got a hole in, it wouldn't be a hoop otherwise, would it, mush!

TERRY JONES:
No, there's a gap in the middle, there.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, a gahp. A gahp in one's hhhhhoop. Pardon me, but I'm off to play the grand piano.

TERRY JONES:
Look, I can see you're on a wire - look, there it is.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Look, I told you, you bastard, I'm not on a wire.

TERRY JONES:
You are. There is.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
There isn't.

TERRY JONES:
Is.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Isn't!

TERRY JONES:
Is!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Isn't!!

TERRY JONES:
Is!!!

JOHN CLEESE:
Anyway, this rather pointless bickering went on for some time until...

TERRY JONES:
Gosh, I am glad I'm a fully qualified arline pilot.

ERIC IDLE:
The British Airline Pilots Association would like to point out that it takes a chap six years to become a fully qualified airline pilot, and not two.

ERIC IDLE:
Thank you. I didn't want to seem a bit of an old fusspot just now you know, but it's just as easy to get these things right as they are easily found in the BALPA handbook. Oh, one other thing, in the Sherlock Holmes last week Tommy Cooper told a joke about a charter flight, omitting to point out that one must be a member of any organization that charters a plane for at least six months beforehand, before being able to take advantage of it. Did rather spoil the joke for me, I'm afraid.

ERIC IDLE:
My wife just reminded me that on a recent 'High Chapparal' Kathy Kirby was singing glibly about 'Fly me to the Stars' when of course there are no scheduled flights of this kind, or even chartered, available to the general public at the present moment, although of course, when they are BALPA will be in the vanguard. Or the Trident. Little joke for the chaps up at BALPA House. And one other small point. Why is it that these new lurex dancing tights go baggy at the knees after only a couple of evenings' fun? Bring back the old canvas ones I say. It is incredible, isn't it, that in these days when man can walk on the moon and work out the most complicated hire purchase agreements, I still get these terrible headaches. Well . .. I seem to have wandered a bit, but still, no harm done. Jolly good luck.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh my God. Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I thought this was the bally toilet.

JOHN CLEESE:
This is the control cabin.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh I know that. I'm a flying man, you know... oh yes... Bally stupid mistake...

JOHN CLEESE:
Cloud's heavy ... What's the reading?

TERRY JONES:
4.8... Steady.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
If they had all those dials in the toilet... there wouldn't be room for anything else, would there.

TERRY JONES:
Hello, Geneva this is Roger Five-O ... What is your cloud reading? Hello, Geneva...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I wouldn't fancy flying one of those sitting on the toilet... I mean it'd take the glamour out of being a pilot, wouldn't it, ha ha, flying around the world sitting on a toilet.

TERRY JONES:
Serious?

JOHN CLEESE:
No, not if it keeps at that level, no.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Mind you, if you did fly it from the toilet it would leave a lot more space up here, wouldn't it.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Aaaaaaaaaarrrggghhhhhh!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Bally piece of luck...

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh hello. Everything all right at the back?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Yes, they're as quiet as dormice.

JOHN CLEESE:
Dormice?
