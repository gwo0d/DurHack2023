DIRECTION:
Cut back to the same group of animals minus the elk. Birdsong etc. The elk's remains are smouldering. The owl explodes, Pan away from the woodland clearing to an open field in which at a distance a bishop in full mitre and robes is pacing up and down holding a script. Mr Chigger in a suit approaches the bishop and we zoom in to hear their conversation.

MICHAEL PALIN:
'Oh Mr Belpit your legs are so swollen' ...

DIRECTION:
swollen

DIRECTION:
tries a different voice

MICHAEL PALIN:
'Oh Mr Belpit., .'

TERRY JONES:
Excuse me, excuse me. I saw your advertisement for flying lessons and I'd like to make an application.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Nothing to do with me. I'm not in this show.

TERRY JONES:
Oh I see. D'you ... d'you., . do you know about the flying lessons?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Nothing to do with me. I'm not in this show. This is show five - I'm not in until show eight.

TERRY JONES:
Oh I see.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'm just learning my lines, you know. 'Oh Mr Belpit, your legs...'

TERRY JONES:
Bit awkward, I'm a bit stuck.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, well. Try over there.

DIRECTION:
Bishop points to a secretary some yards away sitting at a desk typing. She wears glasses and is very typically a secretary.

TERRY JONES:
Oh yes, thanks. Thanks a lot.

MICHAEL PALIN:
'Oh Mr Belpit' - not at all - 'your legs are so swollen'.

DIRECTION:
He continues rehearsing as Mr Chigger moves over to the secretary

TERRY JONES:
Excuse me, I saw your advertisement for flying lessons and I'd like to make an application.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Appointment?

TERRY JONES:
Yes, yes.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Certainly. Would you come this way, please.

DIRECTION:
She gets up, clutching a file and trips off in a typical efficient secretary's walk. Mr Chigger follows. Cut to a river. She goes straight in without looking to right or left, as if she does this routine as a matter of course. Mr Chigger follows. Halfway across the river they pass a couple of business executives hurrying in the opposite direction.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Morning, Mr Jones, Mr Barnes.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a forest. They come past towards camera, passing a tea trolley on the way with a tea lady and a couple of men around it.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Morning Mrs Wills.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Morning, luv.

DIRECTION:
Arty shot. Skyline of a short sharp hill, as in Bergman's 'Seventh Seal'. They come in frame right and up and over, passing two men and exchanging 'Good mornings'. Cut to seashore. Tripping along, they pass another executive.

DIRECTION:
Take this to Marketing, would you.

DIRECTION:
They disappear into a cave. We hear footsteps and a heavy door opening.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Just follow me.

TERRY JONES:
Oh thank you.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a shopping street. Camera pans in close-up across road surface.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh, be careful.

TERRY JONES:
Yes, nearly tripped.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Be there soon.

TERRY JONES:
Good. It's a long way, isn't it?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh, get hold of that - watch it.

DIRECTION:
Morning.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Morning. Upstairs. Be careful, it's very steep. Almost there.

DIRECTION:
Camera reaches a GPO tent in middle of road.

DIRECTION:
Morning.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Morning.

DIRECTION:
they emerge from the tent

DIRECTION:
cut to interior office, another identical secretary at the desk

CAROL CLEVELAND:
In here, please.

TERRY JONES:
Thank you.

DIRECTION:
he enters and first secretary trips off he approaches the second secretary

TERRY JONES:
Hello, I saw your advertisement for flying lessons and I'd like to make an appointment.

DIRECTION:
Well, Mr Anemone's on the phone at the moment, but I'm sure he won't mind if you go on in. Through here.

DIRECTION:
He goes through door. Mr Anemone is suspended by a wire about nine feet off the ground. He is on the telephone.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ah, won't be a moment. Make yourself at home.

DIRECTION:
into phone

DIRECTION:
he throws receiver at telephone but misses

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Missed. Now Mr er...

TERRY JONES:
Chigger.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Mr Chigger. So, you want to learn to fly?

TERRY JONES:
Yes.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Right, well, up on the table, arms out, fingers together, knees bent...

TERRY JONES:
No, no, no.

DIRECTION:
very loudly

DIRECTION:
Mr Chigger gets on the table

DIRECTION:
Mr Chigger jumps and lands on the floor

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Rotten. Rotten. You're no bloody use at all. You're an utter bloody wash-out. You make me sick, you weed!

TERRY JONES:
Now look here...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
All right, all right. I'll give you one more chance, get on the table...

TERRY JONES:
Look, I came here to learn how to fly an aeroplane.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
A what?

TERRY JONES:
I came here to learn how to fly an aeroplane.

DIRECTION:
sarcasticaly

DIRECTION:
imitation posh accent

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
'Oh, oh, no more buttered scones for me, mater. I'm off to play the grand piano'. 'Pardon me while I fly my aeroplane.' Now get on the table!

TERRY JONES:
Look. No one in the history of the world has ever been able to fly like that.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, I suppose mater told you that while you were out riding. Well, if people can't fly what am I doing up here?

TERRY JONES:
You're on a wire.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, a wire. I'm on a wire, am I?

TERRY JONES:
Of course you're on a bloody wire.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I am

DIRECTION:
not

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
on a wire. I am flying.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I am flying.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'll show you whether I'm on a wire or not. Give me the 'oop.

TERRY JONES:
What?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, I don't suppose we know what an 'oop is. I suppose pater thought they were a bit common, except on the bleedin' croquet lawn.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, a

DIRECTION:
hoop

TERRY JONES:
.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
'Oh an

DIRECTION:
hoop

DIRECTION:
taking hoop

DIRECTION:
he waves hoop over head and feet

TERRY JONES:
Go on, right the way along.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
All right, all right, all right.

DIRECTION:
he moves hoop all the way along himself allowing the wire to pass through obvious gap in hoop's circumference

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
. Now, where's the bleeding wire, then?

TERRY JONES:
That hoop's got a hole in.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh Eton and Madgalene. The hoop has an hole in. Of course it's got a hole in, it wouldn't be a hoop otherwise, would it, mush!

TERRY JONES:
No, there's a gap in the middle, there.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, a gahp. A gahp in one's hhhhhoop. Pardon me, but I'm off to play the grand piano.

TERRY JONES:
Look, I can see you're on a wire - look, there it is.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Look, I told you, you bastard, I'm not on a wire.

TERRY JONES:
You are. There is.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
There isn't.

TERRY JONES:
Is.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Isn't!

TERRY JONES:
Is!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Isn't!!

TERRY JONES:
Is!!!

JOHN CLEESE:
Anyway, this rather pointless bickering went on for some time until...

DIRECTION:
CAPTION: 'TWO YEARS LATER'

DIRECTION:
Interior cockpit of airliner. Mr Chigger (pilot) and a second pilot sitting at controls.

TERRY JONES:
Gosh, I am glad I'm a fully qualified arline pilot.

DIRECTION:
Cut to BALPA spokesman sitting at a desk. He is in Captain's uniform and has a name plate in front of him on the desk saying 'BALPA Spokesman'.

ERIC IDLE:
The British Airline Pilots Association would like to point out that it takes a chap six years to become a fully qualified airline pilot, and not two.

DIRECTION:
CAPTION: 'FOUR YEARS LATER THAN THE LAST CAPTION'

DIRECTION:
Interior cockpit. For three seconds. Then cut back to BALPA spokesman.

ERIC IDLE:
Thank you. I didn't want to seem a bit of an old fusspot just now you know, but it's just as easy to get these things right as they are easily found in the BALPA handbook. Oh, one other thing, in the Sherlock Holmes last week Tommy Cooper told a joke about a charter flight, omitting to point out that one must be a member of any organization that charters a plane for at least six months beforehand, before being able to take advantage of it. Did rather spoil the joke for me, I'm afraid.

DIRECTION:
phone ring

DIRECTION:
puts phone down

ERIC IDLE:
My wife just reminded me that on a recent 'High Chapparal' Kathy Kirby was singing glibly about 'Fly me to the Stars' when of course there are no scheduled flights of this kind, or even chartered, available to the general public at the present moment, although of course, when they are BALPA will be in the vanguard. Or the Trident. Little joke for the chaps up at BALPA House. And one other small point. Why is it that these new lurex dancing tights go baggy at the knees after only a couple of evenings' fun? Bring back the old canvas ones I say. It is incredible, isn't it, that in these days when man can walk on the moon and work out the most complicated hire purchase agreements, I still get these terrible headaches. Well . .. I seem to have wandered a bit, but still, no harm done. Jolly good luck.

DIRECTION:
Back in the cockpit of the airliner. The two pilots sit there. Atmospheric noise of a big airliner in flight. Suddenly there is a banging on the door at the back of the cockpit.

DIRECTION:
off-screen

DIRECTION:
the two pilots exchange a puzzled look, then shrug and go back to flying; suddenly another series of bangs on door

DIRECTION:
they exchange another look; pause; a heavier bang on the door

DIRECTION:
a crash as he attempts to force it; another crash and the door flies open; Mr Zanie enters

DIRECTION:
suddenly realizing where he is

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh my God. Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I thought this was the bally toilet.

JOHN CLEESE:
This is the control cabin.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh I know that. I'm a flying man, you know... oh yes... Bally stupid mistake...

DIRECTION:
A pause. Zanie remains standing at the back of cockpit. The pilots go on as if he is not there.

JOHN CLEESE:
Cloud's heavy ... What's the reading?

TERRY JONES:
4.8... Steady.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
If they had all those dials in the toilet... there wouldn't be room for anything else, would there.

DIRECTION:
another nervous laugh; not the slightest reaction from the pilots

DIRECTION:
into intercom

TERRY JONES:
Hello, Geneva this is Roger Five-O ... What is your cloud reading? Hello, Geneva...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I wouldn't fancy flying one of those sitting on the toilet... I mean it'd take the glamour out of being a pilot, wouldn't it, ha ha, flying around the world sitting on a toilet.

DIRECTION:
Geneva here. 4.9 ... Heavy... Over.

TERRY JONES:
Serious?

JOHN CLEESE:
No, not if it keeps at that level, no.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Mind you, if you did fly it from the toilet it would leave a lot more space up here, wouldn't it.

DIRECTION:
finally he realizes his attempt at small talk is not working

DIRECTION:
he pushes lever down on the door which opens directly out of the plane

DIRECTION:
he gives it a shoulder charge and flies straight out of the plane

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Aaaaaaaaaarrrggghhhhhh!

DIRECTION:
Plane noise overhead. Continue scream. Outside of a gent's lavatory, there is a big pile of straw. Pause, then Zanie drops onto the straw. He looks up at gent's sign.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Bally piece of luck...

DIRECTION:
He brushes himself down and goes into gents. Cut back to cockpit. A hostess enters from the passenger cabin.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh hello. Everything all right at the back?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Yes, they're as quiet as dormice.

JOHN CLEESE:
Dormice?
