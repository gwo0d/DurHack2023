TERRY JONES:
Mrs Potter - you knew Harold Potter quite well I believe?

ERIC IDLE:
Oh yes quite well.

TERRY JONES:
Yes.

ERIC IDLE:
He was my husband.

TERRY JONES:
Yes. And, er, he never showed any inclination towards being a Scotsman before this happened?

ERIC IDLE:
No, no, not at all. He was not that sort of person...

TERRY JONES:
He didn't wear a kilt or play the bagpipes?

ERIC IDLE:
No, no.

TERRY JONES:
He never got drunk at night or bought home black puddings?

ERIC IDLE:
No, no. Not at all.

TERRY JONES:
He didn't have an inadequate brain capacity?

ERIC IDLE:
No, no, not at all.

TERRY JONES:
I see. So by your account Harold Potter was a perfectly ordinary Englishman without any tendency towards being a Scotsman whatsoever?

ERIC IDLE:
Absolutely, yes.

ERIC IDLE:
Mind you he did always watch Dr Finlay on television.

TERRY JONES:
Ah-hah! ... Well that's it, you see. That's how it starts.

ERIC IDLE:
I beg your pardon?

TERRY JONES:
Well you see Scottishness starts with little things like that, and works up. You see, people don't just turn into a Scotsman for no reason at all...

TERRY JONES:
No further questions!

DONNA READING:
Charles...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Darling...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Darling, darling...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What is it darling?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What! Mr Llewellyn?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
But what can I do?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
So I am!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
This is right up my street!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Now first of all, why would anyone turn into a Scotsman?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no! Only because he has no control over his own destiny! Look I'll show you...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes! So this means that some person or persons unknown is turning all these people into Scotsmen...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I don't know ... I don't know ... all I know is that these people are streaming north of the border at the rate of thousands every hour. If we don't act fast, Scotland will be choked with Scotsmen...

JOHN CLEESE:
Soon Scotland was full of Scotsmen. The over-crowding was pitiful.

JOHN CLEESE:
Three men to a caber.

JOHN CLEESE:
For the few who remained, life was increasingly difficult.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Hello mummy.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh how horrible... Will they stop at nothing?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I meant that rhetorically.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It means, I didn't expect an answer.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Did mummy say anything as she changed?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, what was it?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No ... It's just the incidental music for this scene.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
'Them' ... Wait a minute!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, I meant that metaphorically ... 'Them' ... 'Them' ... She was obviously referring to the people who turned her into a Scotsman. If only we knew who 'They' were ... And why 'They' were doing it... Who are 'Them'?

JOHN CLEESE:
Then suddenly a clue turned up in Scotland. Mr Angus Podgorny, owner of a Dunbar menswear shop, received an order for 48,000,000 kilts from the planet Skyron in the Galaxy of Andromeda.

TERRY JONES:
Angus how are y'going to get 48,000,000 kilts into the van?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'll have t'do it in two goes.

TERRY JONES:
D'you not ken that the Galaxy of Andromeda is two million, two hundred thousand light years away?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Is that so?

TERRY JONES:
Aye ... and you've never been further than Berwick-on-Tweed...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Aye ... but think o' the money dear ... £18.10.0d a kilt ...that's ...

MICHAEL PALIN:
£900,000,000 - and that's without sporrans!

TERRY JONES:
Aye ... I think you ought not to go, Angus.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Aye ... we'd be able to afford writing paper with our names on it... We'd be able to buy that extension to the toilet...

TERRY JONES:
Aye ... but he hasn't signed the order yet, has he?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Who?

TERRY JONES:
Ach ... the man from Andromeda.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Och ... well ... he wasna really a man, d'you ken ...

TERRY JONES:
Not really a man?

MICHAEL PALIN:
He was as strange a thing as ever I saw, or ever I hope to see, God willing. He was a strange unearthly creature - a quivering, glistening mass...

TERRY JONES:
Angus Podgorny, what

TERRY JONES:
y'mean?

MICHAEL PALIN:
He wasna so much a man as... a blancmange!
