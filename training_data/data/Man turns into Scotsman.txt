DIRECTION:
Weird electronic music. Sinister atmosphere. Follow him out of station. Cut-away to flying saucer, over day skyline. Back to Potter as he walks up suburban road. Back to flying saucer. It bleeps as if it has seen its prey and changes direction. Cut back to Potter just about to open his front gate. Shot from over the other side of the road. Cut to flying saucer sending down ray. Potter freezes . . . shivers and turns into a Scotsman with kilt, and red beard. His hand jerks out in front of him and he spins round and scuttles up road in fast motion, to the accompaniment of bagpipe music. Cut to close-up of newspaper with banner headline: 'Man turns into a Scotsman'.

DIRECTION:
Read all abaht it! Read all abaht it! Man turns into Scotsman!

DIRECTION:
Mix through to Potter's front gate. His wife is being interviewed by obvious plainclothes man.

TERRY JONES:
Mrs Potter - you knew Harold Potter quite well I believe?

ERIC IDLE:
Oh yes quite well.

TERRY JONES:
Yes.

ERIC IDLE:
He was my husband.

TERRY JONES:
Yes. And, er, he never showed any inclination towards being a Scotsman before this happened?

DIRECTION:
shocked

ERIC IDLE:
No, no, not at all. He was not that sort of person...

TERRY JONES:
He didn't wear a kilt or play the bagpipes?

ERIC IDLE:
No, no.

TERRY JONES:
He never got drunk at night or bought home black puddings?

ERIC IDLE:
No, no. Not at all.

TERRY JONES:
He didn't have an inadequate brain capacity?

ERIC IDLE:
No, no, not at all.

TERRY JONES:
I see. So by your account Harold Potter was a perfectly ordinary Englishman without any tendency towards being a Scotsman whatsoever?

ERIC IDLE:
Absolutely, yes.

DIRECTION:
suddenly remembering

ERIC IDLE:
Mind you he did always watch Dr Finlay on television.

TERRY JONES:
Ah-hah! ... Well that's it, you see. That's how it starts.

ERIC IDLE:
I beg your pardon?

TERRY JONES:
Well you see Scottishness starts with little things like that, and works up. You see, people don't just turn into a Scotsman for no reason at all...

DIRECTION:
goes rigid: with Scots accent:

TERRY JONES:
No further questions!

DIRECTION:
The words are hardly out of his mouth when he turns into a Scotsman and spins round and disappears up road in fast motion. Pan with him. Cut to bus queue: man in a city suit and bowler hat suddenly changes into a Scotsman with beard, twizzles round and speeds out of shot. Cut to street policeman pointing way for woman with a pram. Suddenly he changes into a Scotsman and scuffles out of shot. She looks aghast for a moment and then she too changes into a Scotsman and hurtles off after him. The baby suddenly develops a beard and the pram follows her. Single shot of black jazz musician in cellar blowing a blues sax solo. He changes and whizzes off. Squad of soldiers being drilled. Suddenly they all change into bearded Scotsmen and race off in unison. Pan with them past sign: 'Welsh Guard'.

DIRECTION:
Quick animated shot of flying saucer disappearing over city skyline.

DIRECTION:
Cut to big close-up of passionate kiss. It goes on for some moments. Foggy lens... romantic music. Keep on big close-up as they talk. She is none too intelligent.

DONNA READING:
Charles...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Darling...

DIRECTION:
Charles...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Darling, darling...

DIRECTION:
Charles... there's something I've got to tell you...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What is it darling?

DIRECTION:
It's daddy ... he's turned into a Scotsman...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What! Mr Llewellyn?

DIRECTION:
Yes, Charles. Help me, please help me.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
But what can I do?

DIRECTION:
Surely, Charles, you're the Chief Scientist at the Anthropological Research Institute, at Butley Down - an expert in what makes people change from one nationality to another.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
So I am!

DIRECTION:
pull out to reveal they are in a laboratory; he is in a white coat, she is in something absurdly sexy

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
This is right up my street!

DIRECTION:
Oh good.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Now first of all, why would anyone turn into a Scotsman?

DIRECTION:
tentatively

DIRECTION:
Em, for business reasons?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no! Only because he has no control over his own destiny! Look I'll show you...

DIRECTION:
He presses a button on a control board and a laboratory TV screen lights op with the words 'only because they have no control over their own destinies'.

DIRECTION:
I see.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes! So this means that some person or persons unknown is turning all these people into Scotsmen...

DIRECTION:
Oh, what kind of heartless fiend could

DIRECTION:
do

DIRECTION:
that to a man?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I don't know ... I don't know ... all I know is that these people are streaming north of the border at the rate of thousands every hour. If we don't act fast, Scotland will be choked with Scotsmen...

DIRECTION:
Ooh!...

DIRECTION:
Zoom in on her face. Cut to as many bearded Scotsmen as possible, hurtling through wood in fast motion. Follow them, ending up with skyline shot as per 'Seventh Seal'. They all still have the arm outstretched in front of them and as always they are accompanied by bagpipe music. Shot of border with large notice: 'Scotland Welcomes You'.

JOHN CLEESE:
Soon Scotland was full of Scotsmen. The over-crowding was pitiful.

DIRECTION:
They all dash across harder and then stop abruptly once they're over. They stand around looking lost.

JOHN CLEESE:
Three men to a caber.

DIRECTION:
Cut to three Scotsmen tossing one caber. Cut to Scots wife in bed with bearded husband. Pull back to reveal five other Scotsmen in the bed. Short but brilliant piece of animation from T. Gilliam to show England emptying of people and Scotland filling up, ending with a till sound and a till sign coming up out of England reading: 'Empty'. Track into England. Film of a deserted street. Wind, a dog sniffing, newspaper blowing along street. Close-up sign on shop door 'Gone to

DIRECTION:
lunch

DIRECTION:
Scotland'. Close-up another sign on a shop door.' 'McClosed'. Shop sign: McWoolworths & Co'.

JOHN CLEESE:
For the few who remained, life was increasingly difficult.

DIRECTION:
Man suddenly folds up newspaper and runs round corner. Re-emerges driving bus. Drives it halfway to stop and then leaps out with bus still moving. Runs to stop, and puts out hand. Bus stops. He leaps on, rings bell, runs round to front and drives the bus off again. As bus drives out of frame we just see a couple of Scotsmen flashing past camera with arms outstretched. Pan slowly round empty football stadium. Eventually we pick up a solitary spectator, halfway up and halfway along in stand opposite where the players come out. He suddenly leaps to his feet cheering. Cut to players tunnel and one player emerging and a referee with ball. They kick off. Player goes straight down field and scores.

DIRECTION:
Spectator disapppointed.

DIRECTION:
A quick shot of flying saucer again.

DIRECTION:
Studio: the laboratory again. Charles is looking through microscope, when the door flies open and she bursts in.

DIRECTION:
Charles! Thank goodness I've found you! It's mummy!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Hello mummy.

DIRECTION:
No, no, mummy's turned into a Scotsman...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh how horrible... Will they stop at nothing?

DIRECTION:
I don't know - do you think they will?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I meant that rhetorically.

DIRECTION:
What does rhetorically mean?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It means, I didn't expect an answer.

DIRECTION:
Oh I see. Oh, you're so clever, Charles.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Did mummy say anything as she changed?

DIRECTION:
with an air of tremendous revelation

DIRECTION:
Yes! she did, now you come to mention it

DIRECTION:
A long pause as he waits expectantly.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, what was it?

DIRECTION:
Oh, she said ... 'Them!'

DIRECTION:
thrilling chord of jangling music and quick zoom into her face

DIRECTION:
Is there someone at the door?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No ... It's just the incidental music for this scene.

DIRECTION:
Oh I see...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
'Them' ... Wait a minute!

DIRECTION:
A

DIRECTION:
whole

DIRECTION:
minute?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, I meant that metaphorically ... 'Them' ... 'Them' ... She was obviously referring to the people who turned her into a Scotsman. If only we knew who 'They' were ... And why 'They' were doing it... Who are 'Them'?

DIRECTION:
Crashing chord... cut to a small still of a Scottish crofier's cottage on a lonely moor. Slow zoom in on the cottage.

JOHN CLEESE:
Then suddenly a clue turned up in Scotland. Mr Angus Podgorny, owner of a Dunbar menswear shop, received an order for 48,000,000 kilts from the planet Skyron in the Galaxy of Andromeda.

DIRECTION:
Mix to interior of highland menswear shop. An elderly Scottish couple are poring over a letter which they have on the counter. Oil lamps etc.

TERRY JONES:
Angus how are y'going to get 48,000,000 kilts into the van?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'll have t'do it in two goes.

TERRY JONES:
D'you not ken that the Galaxy of Andromeda is two million, two hundred thousand light years away?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Is that so?

TERRY JONES:
Aye ... and you've never been further than Berwick-on-Tweed...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Aye ... but think o' the money dear ... £18.10.0d a kilt ...that's ...

DIRECTION:
calculates with abacus

MICHAEL PALIN:
£900,000,000 - and that's without sporrans!

TERRY JONES:
Aye ... I think you ought not to go, Angus.

DIRECTION:
with visionary look in his eyes

MICHAEL PALIN:
Aye ... we'd be able to afford writing paper with our names on it... We'd be able to buy that extension to the toilet...

TERRY JONES:
Aye ... but he hasn't signed the order yet, has he?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Who?

TERRY JONES:
Ach ... the man from Andromeda.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Och ... well ... he wasna really a man, d'you ken ...

DIRECTION:
Creepy music starts to edge in.

DIRECTION:
narrowing eyes

TERRY JONES:
Not really a man?

DIRECTION:
sweating as the music rises

MICHAEL PALIN:
He was as strange a thing as ever I saw, or ever I hope to see, God willing. He was a strange unearthly creature - a quivering, glistening mass...

TERRY JONES:
Angus Podgorny, what

DIRECTION:
do

TERRY JONES:
y'mean?

MICHAEL PALIN:
He wasna so much a man as... a blancmange!

DIRECTION:
Jarring chord.
