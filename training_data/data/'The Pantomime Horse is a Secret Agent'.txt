CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh pantomime horse, that was wonderful.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
No, no, I mustn't. It makes me throw up... oh, I'm so bleeding happy.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh, pantomime horse.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Then...

JOHN CLEESE:
And now the English pantomime horse has very nearly caught up with the Russian pantomime horse, I think he's going to take him any moment now but what is this? What is this?

JOHN CLEESE:
My goodness me it's the Duke of Kent to the rescue...

JOHN CLEESE:
Here you see some English comic actors engaged in a life or death struggle with a rather weak ending. This is typical of the zany madcap world of the irresistible kooky funsters. The English pantomime horse wins and so is assured of a place in British history and a steady job in a merchant bank. Unfortunately, before his pension rights are assured, he catches bronchitis and dies, another victim of the need to finish these shows on time.
