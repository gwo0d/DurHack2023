DIRECTION:
Stock film of amphibious craft brought up on a beach. The front of the craft crashes down and fifty soldiers rush out. We hear schoolgirl voices. Cut to traditional shot thorugh periscope of ocean, cross-sights scanning the hoizon. Submarine-type dramatic noise - motors and asdic. Cut to interior of submarine. A pepperpot looks thorugh the periscope, then looks round at her colleagues.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, it's still raining.

DIRECTION:
Her four companions continue to knit.

ERIC IDLE:
I'm going down the shops.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, be a dear and get me some rats' bane for the budgie's boil. Otherwise I'll put your eyes out.

ERIC IDLE:
Aye, aye, captain.

DIRECTION:
goes out

DIRECTION:
Attention noise from the communication tube. A red light flashes by it.

JOHN CLEESE:
Coo-ee. Torpedo bay.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yoo-hoo. Torpedo bay.

TERRY
JONES:
She said torpedo bay.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, she did, she did.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, she said torpedo bay. She did, she did.

JOHN CLEESE:
Mrs Lieutenant Edale here. Mrs Midshipman Nesbitt's got one of her headaches again, so I put her in the torpedo tube.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Roger, Mrs Edale. Stand by to fire Mrs Nesbitt.

DIRECTION:
Stand by to fire Mrs Nesbitt.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:

DIRECTION:
Oh, that's much better.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a letter as in the last series, plus voice reading it.

ERIC IDLE:
As an admiral who came up through the ranks more times than you've had hot dinners, I wish to join my husband Admiral O.W.A Giveaway in condemning this shoddy misrepresentation of our modern navy. The British Navy is one of the finest and most attractive and butchest fighting forces in the world. I love those white flared trousers and the feel of rough blue serge on those pert little buttocks!

DIRECTION:
Cut to a man at a desk.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'm afraid we are unable to show you any more of that letter. We continue with a man with a stoat through his head.

DIRECTION:
Cut to man with a stoat through his head. He bows. Cut to film of Women's Institute applauding.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And now ...

DIRECTION:
Cut to a lifeboat somewhere at sea miles from any land. In the lifeboat are five bedraggled sailors, at the end of their tether.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Still no sign of land ... How long is it?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
That's a rather personal question, sir.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You stupid git. I meant how long we've been in the lifeboat. You've spoilt the atmosphere now.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'm sorry.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Shut up! We'll have to start again ... Still no sign of land ... how long is it?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Thirty-three days, sir.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Thirty-three days?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I don't think we can hold out much longer. I don't think I did spoil the atmosphere.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Shut up!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'm sorry, I don't think I did.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Of course you did.

DIRECTION:
to third Sailor

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Do you think I spoilt the atmosphere?

ERIC IDLE:
Well, I think you ...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Look, shut up! SHUT UP! ... Still no sign of land ... how long is it?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Thirty-three days.

TERRY
JONES:
Have we started again?

DIRECTION:
he is kicked on the leg by the first sailor

TERRY
JONES:
Wagh!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Still no sign of land ... how long is it?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes. We can't go hold out much longer, sir. We haven't had any food since the fifth day.

ERIC IDLE:
We're done for, we're done for!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Shut up, Maudling. We've just got to keep hoping someone will find us.

TERRY
JONES:
How are you feeling, captain?

JOHN CLEESE:
Not too good ... I ... feel ... so weak.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
We can't hold out much longer.

JOHN CLEESE:
Listen ... chaps ... there's one last chance. I'm done for, I've got a gammy leg, I'm going fast, I'll never get through ... but ... some of you might ... so you'd better eat me.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Eat you, sir?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes. Eat me.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Uuuuggghhh! With a gammy leg?

JOHN CLEESE:
You don't have to eat the leg, Thompson, there's still plenty of good meat ... look at that arm.

ERIC IDLE:
It's not just the leg, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
What do you mean?

ERIC IDLE:
Well, sir ... it's just that ...

JOHN CLEESE:
Why don't you want to eat me?

ERIC IDLE:
I'd rather eat Johnson, sir.

DIRECTION:
he points at fourth sailor

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, so would I, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
I see.

TERRY
JONES:
Well, that's settled then. Everyone eats me.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well ... I ... er ...

ERIC IDLE:
What, sir?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, no, you go ahead, I won't ...

TERRY
JONES:
Nonsense, nonsense, sir, you're starving. Tuck in!

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, no, it's not just that ...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What's the matter with Johnson, sir?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, he's not kosher.

ERIC IDLE:
That depends how we kill him, sir.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, yes, I see that ... well to be quite frank, I like my meat a little more lean. I'd rather eat Hodges.

DIRECTION:
cheerfully

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh well ... all right.

ERIC IDLE:
No, I'd still prefer Johnson.

JOHN CLEESE:
I wish you'd all stop bickering and eat me.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Look! I'll tell you what. Why don't those of us who want to, eat Johnson, then you, sir, can eat my leg and then we'll make a stock of the Captain and then after that we can eat the rest of Johnson cold for supper.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good thinking, Hodges.

TERRY
JONES:
And we'll finnish off with the peaches.

DIRECTION:

MICHAEL PALIN:
We've decided now, we're going to have leg of Hodges ...

DIRECTION:
Boos off-screen. Cut to a letter

JOHN CLEESE:
Dear Sir, I am glad to hear that your studio audience disapproves of the last skit as strongly as I. As a naval officer I abhor the implication that the Royal Navy is a haven for cannibalism. It is well known that we have the problem relatively under control, and that it is the RAF who now suffer the largest casualties in this area. And what do you think the Argylls ate in Aden. Arabs? Yours etc. Captain B.J. Smethwick in a white wine sauce with shallots, mushrooms and garlic.

DIRECTION:
various nasty cannibalistic scenes from Terry Gilliam.

DIRECTION:
Cut to man.

TERRY
JONES:
Stop it, stop it. Stop this cannibalism. Let's have a sketch about clean, decent human beings.
