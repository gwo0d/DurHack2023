MICHAEL PALIN:
Lady Chairman, sir, shareholders, ladies and gentlemen. I have great pleasure in announcing that owing to a cutback on surplus expenditure of twelve million Canadian dollars, plus a refund of seven and a half million Deutschmarks from the Swiss branch, and in addition adding the debenture preference stock of the three and three quarter million to the directors' reserve currency account of seven and a half million, plus an upward expenditure margin of eleven and a half thousand lira, due to a rise in capital investment of ten million pounds, this firm last year made a complete profit of a shilling.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
A shilling Wilkins?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Er, roughly, yes sir.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Wilkins, I am the Chairman of a multi-million pound corporation and you are a very new chartered Accountant. Isn't it possible there may have been some mistake?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well that's very kind of you sir, but I don't think I'm ready to be Chairman yet.

JOHN CLEESE:
Wilkins, Wilkins. This shilling, is it net or gross?

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's British sir.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, has tax been paid on it?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, this is after tax. Owing to the rigorous bite of the income tax five pence of a further sixpence was swallowed up in tax.

JOHN CLEESE:
Five pence of a

JOHN CLEESE:
sixpence?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes sir.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Five pence of a further

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
?

MICHAEL PALIN:
That's right sir.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Then where is the other penny?

MICHAEL PALIN:
... Er.

JOHN CLEESE:
That makes you a penny short Wilkins. Where is it?

MICHAEL PALIN:
... Erm.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Wilkins?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I embezzled it sir.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What all of it?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes all of it.

JOHN CLEESE:
You naughty person.

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's my first. Please be gentle with me.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'm afraid it's my unpleasant duty to inform you that you're fired.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh please, please.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, out!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, there's no place for sentiment in big business.

TERRY JONES:
Oh you're no fun anymore.

ERIC IDLE:
I heard that. Who said that?

TERRY JONES:
No I didn't.

ERIC IDLE:
Right!

ERIC IDLE:
Here is the address to complain to ...

ERIC IDLE:
The Royal Frog Trampling Institute, 16 Rayners Lane, London, W.C. Fields. I'll just repeat that...

ERIC IDLE:
Tristram and Isolde Phillips, 7.30 Covent Garden Saturday (near Sunday) and afterwards at the Inigo Jones Fish Emporium.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And they want to put the licence fee up?

ERIC IDLE:
And now here is a reminder about leaving your radio on during the night. Leave your radio on during the night.
