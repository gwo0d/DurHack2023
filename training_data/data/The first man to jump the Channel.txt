TERRY JONES:
There is an epic quality about the sea which has throughout history stirred the hearts and minds of Englishmen of all nations. Sir Francis Drake, Captain Webb, Nelson of Trafalgar and Scott of the Antartic - all rose to the challenge of the mighty ocean. And today another Englishman may add his name to the golden roll of history: Mr Ron Obvious of Neaps End. For today, Ron Obvious hopes to be the first man to jump the Channel.

DIRECTION:
Ron runs up to group of cheering supporters. An interviewer addresses him.

JOHN CLEESE:
Ron, now let's just get this quite clear - you're intending to jump across the English Channel?

TERRY JONES:
Oh yes, that is correct, yes.

JOHN CLEESE:
And, er, just how far is that?

TERRY JONES:
Oh, well it's twenty-six miles from here to Calais.

JOHN CLEESE:
Er, that's to the beach at Calais?

TERRY JONES:
Well, no, no, provided I get a good lift off and maybe a gust of breeze over the French coast, I shall be jumping into the centre of Calais itself.

DIRECTION:
Brief shot of group of Frenchmen with banner. 'Fin de Cross-Channel jump'.

JOHN CLEESE:
Ron are you using any special techniques to jump this great distance?

TERRY JONES:
Oh no, no. I shall be using an ordinary two-footed jump, er, straight up in the air and across the Channel.

JOHN CLEESE:
I see. Er, Ron, what is the furthest distance that you've jumped, er, so far?

TERRY JONES:
Er, oh, eleven foot six inches at Motspur Park on July 22nd. Er, but I have done nearly twelve feet unofficially.

DIRECTION:
Ron breaks off to make training-type movements.

JOHN CLEESE:
I see. Er, Ron, Ron, Ron, aren't you worried Ron, aren't you worried jumping twenty-six miles across the sea?

TERRY JONES:
Oh, well no, no, no, no. It is in fact easier to jump over sea than over dry land.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well how is that?

TERRY JONES:
Er, well my manager explained it to me. You see if you're five miles out over the English Channel, with nothing but sea underneath you, er, there is a very great impetus to say in the air.

JOHN CLEESE:
I see. Well, er, thank you very much Ron and the very best of luck.

TERRY JONES:
Thank you. Thank you.

DIRECTION:
to camera

DIRECTION:
turns to speak to Vercotti, who has a Mafia suit and dark glasses

JOHN CLEESE:
Mr Vercotti, er Mr Vercotti ... Mr Vercotti...

MICHAEL PALIN:
What?

DIRECTION:
mumbles protestations of innocence

MICHAEL PALIN:
I don't know what you're talking about.

JOHN CLEESE:
Er, no, we're from the BBC, Mr Vercotti.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Who?

JOHN CLEESE:
The BBC.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, oh. I see. I thought, I thought you were the er . .. I like the police a lot, I've got a lot of time for them.

JOHN CLEESE:
Mr, er, Mr Vercotti, what is your chief task as Ron's manager?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well my main task is, er, to fix a sponsor for the big jump.

JOHN CLEESE:
And who is the sponsor?

MICHAEL PALIN:
The Chippenham Brick Company. Ah, they, er, pay all the bills, er, in return for which Ron will be carrying half a hundredweight of their bricks.

DIRECTION:
We see a passport officer checking Ron's passport.

JOHN CLEESE:
I see. Well, er, it looks as if Ron is ready now. He's got the bricks. He's had his passport checked and he's all set to go. And he's off on the first ever cross-Channel jump.

DIRECTION:
Ron runs down the beach and jumps; he lands about four feet into the water

JOHN CLEESE:
Will Ron be trying the cross-Channel jump again soon?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No. No. I'm taking him off the jumps. Er, because I've got something lined up for Ron next week that I think is very much more up his street.

JOHN CLEESE:
Er, what's that?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Er, Ron is going to eat Chichester Cathedral.

DIRECTION:
Cut to Chichester Cathedral. Ron walks up to it, brushing his teeth.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, there he goes, Ron Obvious of Neaps End, in an attempt which could make him the first man ever to eat an entire Anglican Cathedral.
