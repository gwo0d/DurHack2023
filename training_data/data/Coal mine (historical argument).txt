JOHN CLEESE:
The coal miners of Wales have long been famed for their tough rugged life hewing the black gold from the uncompromising hell of one mile under. This is

JOHN CLEESE:
the story of such men, battling gallantly against floods, roof falls, the English criminal law, the hidden killer carbon monoxide and the ever-present threat of pneumoconiosis which is... a disease miners get.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Don't you talk to me like that, you lying bastard.

TERRY
JONES:
You bleeding pig. You're not fit to be down a mine.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Typical bleeding Rhondda, isn't it. You think you're so bloody clever.

ERIC IDLE:
You bloody fighting again. Break it up or I'll put this pick through your head. Now what's it all about?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
He started it.

TERRY
JONES:
Oh, you bleeding pig, you started it.

ERIC IDLE:
I don't care who bloody started it. What's it about?

TERRY
JONES:
Well ... he said the bloody Treaty of Utrecht was 1713.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
So it bloody is.

TERRY
JONES:
No it bloody isn't. It wasn't ratified 'til February 1714.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
He's bluffing. You're mind's gone, Jenkins. You're rubbish.

ERIC IDLE:
He's right, Jenkins. It was ratified September 1713. The whole bloody pit knows that. Look in Trevelyan, page 468.

MICHAEL PALIN:
He's thinking of the Treaty of bloody Westphalia.

TERRY
JONES:
Are you saying I don't know the difference between the War of the bloody Spanish Succession and the Thirty bloody Years War?

MICHAEL PALIN:
You don't know the difference between the Battle of Borodino and a tiger's bum.

ERIC IDLE:
Break it up, break it up.

ERIC IDLE:
I'm sick of all this bloody fighting. If it's not the bloody Treaty of Utrecht it's the bloody binomial theorem. This isn't the senior common room at All Souls, it's the bloody coal face.

IAN DAVIDSON:
Hey, gaffer, can you settle something? Morgan here says you find the abacus between the triglyphs in the frieze section of the entablature of classical Greek Doric temples.

ERIC IDLE:
You bloody fool, Morgan, that's the metope. The abacus is between the architrave and the aechinus in the capital.

TERRY GILLIAM:
You stinking liar.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, most magnificent and merciful majesty, master of the universe, protector of the meek, whose nose we are not worthy to pick and whose very feces are an untrammelled delight, and whose peacocks keep us awake all hours of the night with their noisy lovemaking, we beseech thee, tell thy humble servants the name of the section between the triglyphs in the frieze section of a classical Doric entablature.

JOHN CLEESE:
No idea. Sorry.

ERIC IDLE:
Right. Everybody out.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Still no settlement in the coal mine dispute at Llanddarog. Miners refused to return to work until the management define a metope. Meanwhile, at Dagenham the unofficial strike committee at Fords have increased their demands to thirteen reasons why Henry III was a bad king. And finally, in the disgusting objects international at Wembley tonight, England beat Spain by a plate of braised pus to a putrid heron. And now, the Toad Elevating Moment.
