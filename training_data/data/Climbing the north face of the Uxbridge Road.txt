MICHAEL PALIN:
Climbing. The world's loneliest sport, where hardship and philosophy go hand in glove. And here, another British expedition, attempting to be the first man to successfully climb the north face of the Uxbridge Road.

MICHAEL PALIN:
This four-man rope has been climbing tremendously. BBC cameras were there to film every inch.

ERIC IDLE:
Well they've spent a good night in there last night in preparation for the final assault today. The leader of the expedition is twenty-nine-year-old Bert Tagg - a local headmaster and mother of three.

JOHN CLEESE:
Bert. How's it going?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, it's a bit gripping is this, Chris.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
damn ... I'm doing it, er, by laying back on this gutter so I'm kind of guttering and laying back at the same time, and philosophizing.

JOHN CLEESE:
Bert, some people say this is crazy.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Aye, well but they said Crippen was crazy didn't they?

JOHN CLEESE:
Crippen

JOHN CLEESE:
crazy.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, well there you are then.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Lemon curry?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Now you see he's putting a peg down there because I'm quite a way up now, and if I come unstuck here I go down quite a long way.

JOHN CLEESE:
Such quiet courage is typical of the way these brave chaps shrug off danger. Like it or not, you've got to admire the skill that goes into it.
