MICHAEL PALIN:
Climbing. The world's loneliest sport, where hardship and philosophy go hand in glove. And here, another British expedition, attempting to be the first man to successfully climb the north face of the Uxbridge Road.

DIRECTION:
Pull out to reveal that they are climbing along a wide pavement; a shopper pushing a pram comes into shot

MICHAEL PALIN:
This four-man rope has been climbing tremendously. BBC cameras were there to film every inch.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a BBC cameraman clinging to a lamppost, filming. He is wearing climbing gear too. Cut to papier mache model of the Uxbridge Road, with the route all neatly marked out in white, and various little pins for the camps.

DIRECTION:
voice over

DIRECTION:
cut to a pup tent being firmly planted on the side of a large post-box; it has a little union jack on it.

ERIC IDLE:
Well they've spent a good night in there last night in preparation for the final assault today. The leader of the expedition is twenty-nine-year-old Bert Tagg - a local headmaster and mother of three.

DIRECTION:
Cut to Bert crawling along the pavement. The interviewer is crouching down beside him.

JOHN CLEESE:
Bert. How's it going?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, it's a bit gripping is this, Chris.

DIRECTION:
heavy breathing interspersed

DIRECTION:
rearranging rope

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
damn ... I'm doing it, er, by laying back on this gutter so I'm kind of guttering and laying back at the same time, and philosophizing.

JOHN CLEESE:
Bert, some people say this is crazy.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Aye, well but they said Crippen was crazy didn't they?

JOHN CLEESE:
Crippen

DIRECTION:
was

JOHN CLEESE:
crazy.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, well there you are then.

DIRECTION:
shouts

DIRECTION:
there is a white rope between Bert and John

DIRECTION:
Quick cut to Viking.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Lemon curry?

DIRECTION:
Cut back to the street.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Now you see he's putting a peg down there because I'm quite a way up now, and if I come unstuck here I go down quite a long way.

DIRECTION:
leaving him

JOHN CLEESE:
Such quiet courage is typical of the way these brave chaps shrug off danger. Like it or not, you've got to admire the skill that goes into it.

DIRECTION:
By the miracle of stop action, they all fall off the road, back down the pavement. Passers-by, also in stop action, walk by normally, ignoring the fall.
