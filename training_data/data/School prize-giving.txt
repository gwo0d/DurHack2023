MICHAEL PALIN:
My Lord Mayor, Lady Mayoress, it gives me very great pleasure to return to my old school, to present the prizes in this centenary year. This school takes very justifiable pride in its fine record of... aaaaagh!

DIRECTION:
Hands pull him down behind the table. Fighting, punching, struggle, grunts etc. No reaction at all from the distinguished guests. The bishop's head reappears for a moment.

MICHAEL PALIN:
... scholarship and sporting achievement in all... aaaagh!

DIRECTION:
He disappears again. More noises. Up comes another bishop dressed identically.

ERIC IDLE:
I'm, I'm afraid there's been a mistake. The man who has been speaking to you is an impostor. He is not in fact the Bishop of East Anglia, but a man wanted by the police.

DIRECTION:
I

DIRECTION:
he puts the silver cup into a sack

ERIC IDLE:
Next we come to the Fairfax Atkinson Trophy for outstanding achievement in the field of Applied Mathematics. Well, there was no-one this year who reached the required standard so it goes in my sack. And by an old rule of the school all the other silver trophies also go in my sack ... aaagh!

DIRECTION:
He is dragged down by an unseen hand. More sounds of fighting, noisier than before even. A Chinaman in Mao jacket and cap appears.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Velly solly for hold-up ... no ploblem now ... me are Bishop of East Anglia, now piesent plizes ... Eyes down for first plize ... The Fyffe-Chulmleigh Spoon for Latin Elegaics... 'goes to ... People's Republic of China! Aaaagh!

DIRECTION:
The Chinaman is dragged down beneath the table as were the others. Again sound of struggle, thumps etc. A plainclothes policeman stands up.

TERRY JONES:
Good evening, everybody. My name's Bradshaw - Inspector Elizabeth Bradshaw, of the Special Branch Speech Day Squad, but I'd like you to think of me as the Bishop of East Anglia, and I'd like to present the first prize, the Grimwade Gynn Trophy to...

DIRECTION:
A shot. He leaps backwards. Sound of machine guns and exploding shells. Two men in army uniform with camouflage sticking out of tin helmets rush up to the table and exchange fire. They have a huge bazooka which they fire from time to time.

DIRECTION:
appearing from beneath the table, shouting above the din of the battle

DIRECTION:
explosion and smoke, debris over the stage

DIRECTION:
explosion

DIRECTION:
a wretched schoolboy appears on the stage keeping his head down

DIRECTION:
he manages to get the cup but as he stands to shake hands he is shot

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh... bad luck! The next prize...
