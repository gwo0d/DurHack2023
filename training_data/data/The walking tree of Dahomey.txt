DIRECTION:
a native whispers in his ear

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, super ... well, I've just been told that this is not in fact the legendary walking tree of Dahomey, this is one of Africa's many stationary trees, Arborus Barnbet Gaseoignus. In fact we've just missed the walking tree... it left here at eight o'clock this morning... was heading off in that direction... so we'll see if we can go and catch it up. Come on boys.

DIRECTION:
They move off. At this point we notice that there are two other saxophone-wearing natives, a trumpeter, a trombonist, a double bassist, a guitarist, and finally a man with a drum kit tied to his back. Mix through to them on the move in another pan of the jungle. Sweat is now spraying out from under Attenborough's armpits as if from a watering can.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, we're still keeping up with it, but it's setting a furious pace. Early this morning we thought we'd spotted it, but it turned out to be an Angolan sauntering tree, Amazellus Robin Ray, out walking with a Gambian Sidling Bush...

Jeremy Thorpe leans in the background and waves to camera

DIRECTION:
Rupert the bearer points excitedly

DIRECTION:
they move off, by this time waterspray is gushing out from all over his chest

MICHAEL PALIN:
But, what Rupert had in fact discovered was something very different...

DIRECTION:
He stops him, they kneel down. Cut to their eyeline. In the distance, amongst low bushes and thick undergrowth, six Africans dressed immaculately in cricket gear having a game of cricket. Cut to Attenborough, Rupert and one other bearer watching. Attenborough is looking down at something he is holding. The other two are gazing wide-eyed at the cricketers.

MICHAEL PALIN:
The Turkish Little Rude Plant.

DIRECTION:
he holds up, carefully and wondrously, a plant which has green outer leaves splayed back to reveal a small, accurately sculpted bum

DIRECTION:
Rupert nudges him and points excitedly at the batsmen

DIRECTION:
Attenborough points, apparently at the batsmen, but he has clearly got it wrong again

DIRECTION:
Rupert nudges him again
