GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
We'll have to watch the telly then.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What's that on the tellevision then?

JOHN CLEESE:
Looks like a penguin.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no, no, I didn't mean what's on the television set, I meant what programme.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh.

JOHN CLEESE:
It's funny that penguin being there innit? What's it doing there?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Standing.

JOHN CLEESE:
I can see that!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
If it lays an egg, it will fall down the back of the television set.

JOHN CLEESE:
We'll have to watch that. Unless it's a male.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ooh, I never thought of that.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, looks fairly butch.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Per'aps it's from next door.

JOHN CLEESE:
Penguins don't come from next door, they come from the Antarctic.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Burma.

JOHN CLEESE:
Why did say Burma?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I panicked.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh. Perhaps it's from the zoo.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Which zoo?

JOHN CLEESE:
How should I know which zoo? I'm not Doctor bloody Bernowski.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
How does Doctor Bernowski know which zoo it came from?

JOHN CLEESE:
He knows everything.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oooh, I wouldn't like that, that'd take all the mystery out of life. Anyway, if it came from the zoo, it would have 'property of the zoo' stamped on it.

JOHN CLEESE:
No it wouldn't. They don't stamp animals 'property of the zoo'. You can't stamp a huge lion.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
They stamp them when they're small.

JOHN CLEESE:
What happens when they moult?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Lions don't moult.

JOHN CLEESE:
No, but penguins do. There, I've run rings around you logically.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, intercourse the penguin.

TERRY JONES:
It's just gone 8 o'clock and time for the penguin on top of your television set to explode.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
How did he know that was going to happen?!

TERRY JONES:
It was an inspired guess. And now...

JOHN CLEESE:
Number twenty-three. The shin.

JOHN CLEESE:
Number twenty-four. Reginald's Maulding's shin

JOHN CLEESE:
Number twenty-five. The brain.

JOHN CLEESE:
Number twenty-six. Magaret Thatcher's brain.

JOHN CLEESE:
Number twenty-seven. More naughty bits.

JOHN CLEESE:
Number twenty-eight. The naughty bits of the cabinet.

JOHN CLEESE:
Number twenty-nine. The interior of a country house.
