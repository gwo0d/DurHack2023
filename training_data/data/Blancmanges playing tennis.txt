ERIC IDLE:
Well, here at Wimbledon, it's been a most extraordinary week's tennis. The blancmanges have swept the board, winning match after match. Here are just a few of the results: Billie-Jean King eaten in straight sets, Laver smothered whole after winning the first set, and Poncho Gonzales, serving as well as I've never seen him, with some superb volleys and decisive return volleys off the back hand, was sucked through the net at match point and swallowed whole in just under two minutes. And so, here on the final day, there seems to be no players left to challenge the blancmanges. And this could be their undoing, Dan: as the rules of Wimbledon state quite clearly that there must be at least one human being concerned in the final.

ERIC IDLE:
there is a human with it. It's Angus Podgorny! The plucky little Scottish tailor ... upon whom everything depends. And so it's Podgorny versus blancmange in this first ever Intergalactic Wimbledon!

ERIC IDLE:
And it's blancmange to serve and it's a good one.

ERIC IDLE:
Fifteen love.

ERIC IDLE:
And Podgorny fails to even hit the ball ... but this is no surprise as he hasn't hit the ball once throughout this match. So it's 72 match points to the blancmange now... Podgorny prepares to serve again.

ERIC IDLE:
This is indeed a grim day for the human race, Dan.

ERIC IDLE:
But what's this? Two spectators have rushed onto the pitch with spoons and forks... what are they going to do?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
They mean to eat the blancmange.

ERIC IDLE:
And they're eating the blancmange ... Yes! The blancmange is leaving the court... it's abandoning the game! This is fantastic!

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes it was Mr and Mrs Samuel Brainsample, who, after only a brief and misleadling appearance in the early part of the film, returned to save the Earth ... but why?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, well you see we love blancmanges. My wife makes them.

JOHN CLEESE:
She makes blancmanages

JOHN CLEESE:
size?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, yes. You see we're from the planet Skyron in the Galaxy of Andromeda, and they're all that size there. We tried to tell you at the beginning of the film but you just panned off us.

JOHN CLEESE:
So the world was saved! And Angus Podgorny became the first Scotsman to win Wimbledon... fifteen years later.
