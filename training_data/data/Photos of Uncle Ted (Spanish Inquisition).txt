MARJORIE WILDE:
And the is the Spanish Inquisition hiding behind the coal shed.

DIRECTION:
Friend takes it with the first sign of real interest.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh! I didn't expect a Spanish Inquisition.

DIRECTION:
Jarring chord. The door flies open and Ximinez, Biggles and Fang enter.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!

DIRECTION:
Cut to film: moving over Breugel drawing of tortures; epic film music.

DIRECTION:
and CAPTION:

JOHN CLEESE:
'IN THE EARLY YEARS OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY, TO COMBAT THE RISING TIDE OF RELIGIOUS UNORTHODOXY, THE POPE GAVE CARDINAL XIMINEZ OF SPAIN LEAVE TO MOVE WITHOUT LET OR HINDRANCE THROUGHOUT THE LAND, IN A REIGN OF VIOLENCE, TERROR AND TORTURE THAT MAKES A SMASHING FILM. THIS WAS THE SPANISH INQUISITION...'

DIRECTION:
Torchlit dungeon. We hear clanging footsteps. Shadows on the Grille. The footsteps stop and keys jangle. The great door creaks open and Ximinez walks in and looks round approvingly. Fang and Biggles enter behind pushing in the dear old lady. They chain her to the wall.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Now, old woman! You are accused of heresy on three counts. Heresy by thought, heresy by word, heresy by deed, and heresy by action.

DIRECTION:
Four

MICHAEL PALIN:
counts. Do you confess?

DIRECTION:
I don't understand what I'm accused of.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ha! Then we shall

DIRECTION:
make

MICHAEL PALIN:
you understand...Biggles! Fetch...the cushions!

DIRECTION:
Jarring chord. Biggles holds out two ordinary modern household cushions.

TERRY JONES:
Here they are, lord.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Now, old lady, you have one last chance. Confess the heinous sin of heresy, reject the works of the ungodly -

DIRECTION:
two

DIRECTION:
three

MICHAEL PALIN:
last chances. You have three last chances, the nature of which I have divulged in my previous utterance.

DIRECTION:
I don't know what you're talking about.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right! If that's the way you want it - Cardinal! Poke her with the soft cushions!

DIRECTION:
Biggles carries out this rather pathetic torture

MICHAEL PALIN:
Confess! Confess! Confess!

TERRY JONES:
It doesn't seem to be hurting her, my lord.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Have you got all the stuffing up one end?

TERRY JONES:
Yes, lord.

DIRECTION:
angrily hurling away the cushions

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hm! She is made of harder stuff! Cardinal Fang - fetch...the comfy chair!

DIRECTION:
Another loud jarring chord. Zoom in on Fang's horrified face.

TERRY GILLIAM:
The comfy chair?

DIRECTION:
Fang pushes in a comfy chair - a really plush one.

MICHAEL PALIN:
So you think you are strong because you can survive the soft cushions. Well, we shall see. Biggles! Put her in the Comfy Chair!

DIRECTION:
Biggles roughly push her into the comfy chair

DIRECTION:
to Biggles

MICHAEL PALIN:
Is that really all it is?

TERRY JONES:
Why, yes lord.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I see. I suppose we make it worse by shouting a lot, do we? Confess, woman. Confess! Confess!

DIRECTION:
Confess! Confess!

TERRY JONES:
I confess!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Not you!

DIRECTION:
I confess.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Who was that?

DIRECTION:
ANIMATION:

DIRECTION:
'I confess'
