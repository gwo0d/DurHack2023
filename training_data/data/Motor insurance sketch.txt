DIRECTION:
Oh! And the next item is called 'Insurance Sketch'. 'Insurance Sketch'. 'Insurance Sketch'...

DIRECTION:
Cut to Mr Devious's insurance office. Devious and a man are sitting there.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What do you want?

DIRECTION:
SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'STRAIGHT MAN'

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well I've come about your special fully comprehensive motor insurance policy offer...

MICHAEL PALIN:
What was that?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Fully comprehensive motor insurance for one-and-eightpence.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, oh, yes...yeah well, unfortunately, guv, that offer's no longer valid. You see, it turned out not to be commercially viable, so we now have a totally new offer...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What's that?

MICHAEL PALIN:
A nude lady.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
A nude lady?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes. You get a nude lady with a fully comprehensive motor insurance. If you just want third party she has to keep her bra on, and if it's just theft...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no, I don't really want that, Mr er...Mr...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Devious.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Mr Devious. I just want to know what it would cost me to have a fully comprehensive inurance on a 1970 Aston Martin.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Aston Martin?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes.

DIRECTION:
quickly

MICHAEL PALIN:
Five hundred quid.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Five hundred quid?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Forty quid.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Forty quid?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Forty quid and a nude lady.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no, I'm not interested in a nude lady.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Dirty books?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no, look, I'm not interested in any af that.

DIRECTION:
superimposed 'STRAIGHT MAN' caption again

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I just want to know what it would cost me to have a fully comprehensive insurance on a 1970 Aston Martin. Can you please qoute me your price.

DIRECTION:
Cut to outside the door of the office. A vicar stands there.

ERIC IDLE:
Knock knock.

DIRECTION:
Cut to inside office.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Who's there

DIRECTION:
Cut to outside.

ERIC IDLE:
The Reverend...

DIRECTION:
Cut to inside.

MICHAEL PALIN:
The Reverend who?

ERIC IDLE:
The reverend Morrison.

DIRECTION:
CAPTION: 'ANOTHER STRAIGHT MAN'

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, come in.

DIRECTION:
The vicar enters.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Now then, vic. What's the trouble?

ERIC IDLE:
Well, it's about this letter you sent me.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Excuse me, do I have any more lines?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I don't know, mush, I'll have to look in the script...

DIRECTION:
he gets script out of drawer

MICHAEL PALIN:
Where are we? Show 8. Are you 'man?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yeah.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No...no, you're finished.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, I'll be off then.

DIRECTION:
he leaves

DIRECTION:
reading script

MICHAEL PALIN:
'The vicar sits'.

DIRECTION:
The vicar sits.

ERIC IDLE:
It's about this letter you sent me regarding my insurance claim.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, yeah, yeah - well, you see, it's just that we're not...as yet...

DIRECTION:
totally

MICHAEL PALIN:
satisfied with the grounds of your claim.

ERIC IDLE:
But it says something about filling my mouth in with cement.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh well, that's just insurance jargon, you know.

ERIC IDLE:
But my car was hit by a lorry while standing in the garage and you refuse to pay my claim.

DIRECTION:
rising and crossing to a filing cabinet

DIRECTION:
he open the drawer of the filing cabinet and takes out a shabby old sports jacket; he feels in the pocket and pulls out a crumbled dog-eared piece of paper then puts the coat back and shuts the filing cabinet

MICHAEL PALIN:
...here we are. It states quite clearly that no claim you make will be paid.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh dear.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You see, you unfortunately plumped for our 'Neverpay' policy, which, you know, if you never claim is very worthwhile...but you had to claim, and, well, there it is.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh dear, oh dear.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Still, never mind - could be worse. How's the nude lady?

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, she's fine.

DIRECTION:
he begins to sob

MICHAEL PALIN:
Look...Rev...I hate to see a man cry, so shove off out the office, there's a good chap.

DIRECTION:
The vicar goes out sobbing. Cut to outside. Vicar collects a nude lady sitting in a supermarket shopping trolley...and wheels her disconsolately away. Cut back to inside of office. Close-up of Devious. He gets out some files and starts writing. Suddenly a bishop's crook slams down on the desk in front of Devious. He looks up - his eyes register terror. Cut to reverse angle shot from below. The bishop in full mitre and robes.

TERRY JONES:
OK, Devious...Don't move!

MICHAEL PALIN:
The bishop!

DIRECTION:
Animated crime-series-type titles, with suitable music:

DIRECTION:
'C. OF E. FILMS'

DIRECTION:
'IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE SUNDAY SCHOOLS BOARD'

DIRECTION:
'PRESENT'

DIRECTION:
'THE BISHOP'

DIRECTION:
'STARRING THE REVEREND E. P. NESBITT'

DIRECTION:
'SPECIAL EFFECTS BY THE MODERATOR OF THE CHURCH OF SCOTLAND'

DIRECTION:
'DIRECTED BY PREBENDARY "CHOPPER" HARRIS'

DIRECTION:
Exterior beautiful English church. Birds singing, a hymn being sung. Suddenly, sound of a high-powered car roaring towards the church. Screech of tires as a huge open-top American car screeches to a halt outside the church. The bishop leaps out. Behind him (as throughout the film) are his four henchmen... vicars with dark glasses. They wear clerical suits and dog collars. They leap out of their car and race up the drive towards the church. As they do so the hymn is heard to come to an end. Sound of people sitting down.

DIRECTION:
Cut to interior of church. Vicar climbing up into pulpit. Cut back to exterior. The bishop and his vicars racing through the doors. Interior of church. Shot of vicar in pulpit.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I take as my text for today...

DIRECTION:
Cut to bishop and vicars at doorway.

TERRY JONES:
The text, vic! Don't say the text!

DIRECTION:
Cut back to vicar.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Leviticus 3-14. . .

DIRECTION:
The pulpit explodes. Vicar disappears in smoke, flying up into the air. Cut to close-up of the bishop. Behind him there is smoke and people rushing about. Sound of people scrambling over pews in panic etc.

TERRY JONES:
We was too late. The Reverend Grundy bit the ceiling.

DIRECTION:
The end of the bishop's crook suddenly starts flashing. He lifts the flashing end off and it stops. Using it like a telephone receiver, he speaks into the staff.

TERRY JONES:
Hello? ... What?... We'll be right over!

DIRECTION:
Still of another church exterior. Crash zoom in on door. Cut to interior. A baptism party round the font. An innocent vicar is just testing the water. Pan across to the parents - a couple of shifty crooks - and two godmothers, obviously all-in wrestlers in drag (cauliflower ears etc.). As the vicar takes the baby it starts to tick loudly.

JOHN CLEESE:
And it is for this reason that the Christian Church lays upon you, the godparents, the obligation of seeing this child is brought up in the Christian faith. Therefore, I name this child...

DIRECTION:
Cut to door of church. The bishop and vicars rush in.

TERRY JONES:
Don't say the kid's name, vic!

JOHN CLEESE:
Francesco Luigi...

DIRECTION:
Explosion. Cut to close-up of bishop. Smoke and panic as before.

TERRY JONES:
We was too late... The Rev. Neuk saw the light.

DIRECTION:
Whip pan to interior of yet another church. A wedding. Bride and groom standing in front of a vicar. Cut to door of church. The bishop and vicars burst in.

TERRY JONES:
The ring, vic Don't touch the ring! Hey vic!

DIRECTION:
Cut to vicar taking the ring out of the bible. The ring is attached to a piece of string. A sixteen-ton weight falls on top of them with a mighty crunch - the camera shakes as it hits the floor.

DIRECTION:
Cut to two bell ringers. One pulls his rope, and the other rises off the floor, hanged by the neck. The bishop arrives, just too late.

DIRECTION:
Cut to another vicar at graveside.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
... dust to dust, ashes to ashes.

DIRECTION:
He sprinkles dust on the grave. A huge prop cannon rises up out of the grave until its mighty barrel (twelve inches wide) is pointing right in the vicar's face. He does not notice. Sound of car screeching to a halt. We pan away from grave to reveal the bishop leaping out of the car. Sound of an almighty blast from the cannon. The bishop gets back into the car immediately and turns it round.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a street. Outside a cigarette shop the four clerics lounge against a wall. The bishop walks out rolling his own. Suddenly he stops. Close-up. He looks up as he hears a faint cry. Camera swings round and up - enormous zoom to high window in huge, drab city office block, where a vicar is looking out.

ERIC IDLE:
Help ... help... help... help... help... help...

DIRECTION:
Cut back to the bishop breaking into a run, throwing his cigarette into the gutter. Peter Gunn music. Hand-held shots of the bishop and the four vicars running through crowded streets. He reaches the office block, rushes in. Interior: a stair well. Right at the bottom we see the bishop and the vicars. Close-up hand-held shot of bishop running up stairs. Shadows running up the stair well. The bishop arrives on the top landing. Door of office. The bishop tries the door. It won't open. One vicar goes rigid. The other three take hold of him and use him as a battering ram and go straight through the balsa wood door first time.

TERRY JONES:
OK, Devious, don't move!

DIRECTION:
'The Bishop' titles again.

DIRECTION:
Cut to interior of cinema. A couple holding hands. Bishop film titles start up again exactly as before. After a couple of seconds of titles we cut to an old couple sitting in the back row of the cinema facing camera. The sound of the bishop's titles continues. The light from the projector is streaming out above their heads.

MICHAEL PALIN:
This is where we came in.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes.

DIRECTION:
Cut immediately to the front of the cinema. A working-class lounge is arranged on the pavement. There are no walls, just the furnishings: settee, two armchairs, sideboard, table, standard lamp, a tiled fireplace with ornaments on it. There is also a free-standing inside door. Mr and Mrs Potter come out of the cinema and go straight to their chairs and sit down. Passers-by have to skirt the living-room furniture.

DIRECTION:
settling into her chair

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, it's nice to be home.

DIRECTION:
looking round

MICHAEL PALIN:
Builders haven't been then.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No.

DIRECTION:
A trendy interviewer with hand mike comes into shot.

ERIC IDLE:
These two old people are typical of the housing problem facing Britain's aged.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Here! Don't you start doing a documentary on us, young man.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh please ...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, you leave us alone!

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, just a little one about the appalling conditions under which you live.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No! Get out of our house! Go on!

DIRECTION:
Interviewer turns, motions to his cameraman and soundman and they all trail off miserably.

DIRECTION:
Oh all right. Come on, George, pick it up.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Why don't you do a documentary about the drug problem round in Walton Street?

DIRECTION:
Cut to the camera crew. They stop, turn and mutter 'a drug problem!' and they dash off.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, I'll go and have a bath.

DIRECTION:
She goes to the free-standing door and opens it. Beyond it we see the furnishings of a bathroom. In the bath is Alfred Lord Tennyson, fully clad. As she opens the door we hear him reciting:

DIRECTION:
The splendour fans on castle walls

DIRECTION:
And snowy summits old in story...

DIRECTION:
She slams the door.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
'Ere, there's Alfred Lord Tennyson in the bathroom.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, at least the poet's been installed, then.
