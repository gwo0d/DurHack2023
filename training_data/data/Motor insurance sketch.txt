MICHAEL PALIN:
What do you want?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well I've come about your special fully comprehensive motor insurance policy offer...

MICHAEL PALIN:
What was that?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Fully comprehensive motor insurance for one-and-eightpence.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, oh, yes...yeah well, unfortunately, guv, that offer's no longer valid. You see, it turned out not to be commercially viable, so we now have a totally new offer...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What's that?

MICHAEL PALIN:
A nude lady.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
A nude lady?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes. You get a nude lady with a fully comprehensive motor insurance. If you just want third party she has to keep her bra on, and if it's just theft...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no, I don't really want that, Mr er...Mr...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Devious.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Mr Devious. I just want to know what it would cost me to have a fully comprehensive inurance on a 1970 Aston Martin.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Aston Martin?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Five hundred quid.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Five hundred quid?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Forty quid.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Forty quid?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Forty quid and a nude lady.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no, I'm not interested in a nude lady.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Dirty books?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no, look, I'm not interested in any af that.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I just want to know what it would cost me to have a fully comprehensive insurance on a 1970 Aston Martin. Can you please qoute me your price.

ERIC IDLE:
Knock knock.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Who's there

ERIC IDLE:
The Reverend...

MICHAEL PALIN:
The Reverend who?

ERIC IDLE:
The reverend Morrison.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, come in.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Now then, vic. What's the trouble?

ERIC IDLE:
Well, it's about this letter you sent me.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Excuse me, do I have any more lines?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I don't know, mush, I'll have to look in the script...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Where are we? Show 8. Are you 'man?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yeah.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No...no, you're finished.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, I'll be off then.

MICHAEL PALIN:
'The vicar sits'.

ERIC IDLE:
It's about this letter you sent me regarding my insurance claim.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, yeah, yeah - well, you see, it's just that we're not...as yet...

MICHAEL PALIN:
satisfied with the grounds of your claim.

ERIC IDLE:
But it says something about filling my mouth in with cement.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh well, that's just insurance jargon, you know.

ERIC IDLE:
But my car was hit by a lorry while standing in the garage and you refuse to pay my claim.

MICHAEL PALIN:
...here we are. It states quite clearly that no claim you make will be paid.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh dear.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You see, you unfortunately plumped for our 'Neverpay' policy, which, you know, if you never claim is very worthwhile...but you had to claim, and, well, there it is.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh dear, oh dear.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Still, never mind - could be worse. How's the nude lady?

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, she's fine.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Look...Rev...I hate to see a man cry, so shove off out the office, there's a good chap.

TERRY JONES:
OK, Devious...Don't move!

MICHAEL PALIN:
The bishop!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I take as my text for today...

TERRY JONES:
The text, vic! Don't say the text!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Leviticus 3-14. . .

TERRY JONES:
We was too late. The Reverend Grundy bit the ceiling.

TERRY JONES:
Hello? ... What?... We'll be right over!

JOHN CLEESE:
And it is for this reason that the Christian Church lays upon you, the godparents, the obligation of seeing this child is brought up in the Christian faith. Therefore, I name this child...

TERRY JONES:
Don't say the kid's name, vic!

JOHN CLEESE:
Francesco Luigi...

TERRY JONES:
We was too late... The Rev. Neuk saw the light.

TERRY JONES:
The ring, vic Don't touch the ring! Hey vic!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
... dust to dust, ashes to ashes.

ERIC IDLE:
Help ... help... help... help... help... help...

TERRY JONES:
OK, Devious, don't move!

MICHAEL PALIN:
This is where we came in.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, it's nice to be home.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Builders haven't been then.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No.

ERIC IDLE:
These two old people are typical of the housing problem facing Britain's aged.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Here! Don't you start doing a documentary on us, young man.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh please ...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, you leave us alone!

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, just a little one about the appalling conditions under which you live.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No! Get out of our house! Go on!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Why don't you do a documentary about the drug problem round in Walton Street?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, I'll go and have a bath.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
'Ere, there's Alfred Lord Tennyson in the bathroom.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, at least the poet's been installed, then.
