ERIC IDLE:
If I may charge you m'lud, you are charged m'lud that on the fourteenth day of June 1970, at the Central Criminal Court, you did commit acts likely to cause a breach of the peace. How plead you m'lud, guilty or not guilty?

TERRY JONES:
Not guilty. Case not proven. Court adjourned.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, you're in the dock, m'lud.

TERRY JONES:
I'm a judge, m'lud.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
So am I, m'lud, so watch it.

TERRY JONES:
Hah! Call this a court.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Shut up. Right now get on with the spiel.

JOHN CLEESE:
M'lud, and my other lud, the prosecution will endeavour to show m'lud, that m'lud - ah, not you m'lud, that m'lud, m'lud, while passing sentence at the Central Criminal Court blotted his copy book. Call exhibit Q.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Q?

JOHN CLEESE:
Sorry did I say Q? I meant A. Sorry, call exhibit A.

ERIC IDLE:
Call exhibit A.

JOHN CLEESE:
Exhibit A m'lud, Miss Rita Thang, an artist's model, Swedish accordion teacher and cane-chair sales lady, was found guilty under the Rude Behaviour Act in the accused's court. The accused, m'lud, sentenced her to be taken from this place and brought round to his place.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Objection, m'lud.

TERRY JONES:
Objection sustained.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You shut up! Objection overruled.

JOHN CLEESE:
The accused then commented on Miss Thang's bodily structure, made several not-at-all legal remarks on the subject of fun and then placed his robes over his head and began to emit low moans.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Have you anything to say in your defense?

TERRY JONES:
I haven't had any for weeks.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh no? What about that little number you've got tucked away in Belsize Park?

TERRY JONES:
Oh, I never!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh no. Ho! Ho! Ho!

TERRY JONES:
All right then what about 8a Woodford Square?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You say anything about that and I'll do you for treason.

JOHN CLEESE:
M'lud if we could continue ...

TERRY JONES:
He's got a Chinese bit there.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, that's contempt of court.

TERRY JONES:
It was only a joke.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Contempt of court. However, I'm not going to punish you, because we're so short of judges at the moment, what with all of them emigrating to South Africa. I'm going tomorrow; I've got my ticket. Get out there and get some decent sentencing done. Ooh, England makes you sick. Best I can manage here is life imprisonment. It's hardly worth coming in in the morning. Now, South Africa? You've got your cat of nine tails, you've got four death sentences a week, you've got cheap drinks, slave labour and a booming stock market. I'm off, I tell you. Yes, I'm up to here with probation and bleeding psychiatric reports. That's it, I'm off. That's it. Right. But I'm going to have one final fling before I leave, so I sentence you to be burnt at the stake.

TERRY JONES:
Blimey! I didn't expect the Spanish Inquisition.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Two, er, three to the Old Bailey please.

TERRY JONES:
Look they've started the credits.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

TERRY JONES:
Come on hurry. Hurry!

MICHAEL PALIN:
There's the lighting credit, only five left.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hell, it's the producer - quick!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Nobody expects the Spa...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh bugger!
