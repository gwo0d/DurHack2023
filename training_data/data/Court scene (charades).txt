Not guilty. Case not proven. Court adjourned.

So am I, m'lud, so watch it.

TERRY JONES:
Hah! Call this a court.

DIRECTION:
Call this a court. Call this a court..Call this a court.

Exhibit A m'lud, Miss Rita Thang, an artist's model, Swedish accordion teacher and cane-chair sales lady, was found guilty under the Rude Behaviour Act in the accused's court. The accused, m'lud, sentenced her to be taken from this place and brought round to his place.

Objection, m'lud.

You shut up! Objection overruled.

Have you anything to say in your defense?

TERRY JONES:
I haven't had any for weeks.

Oh no? What about that little number you've got tucked away in Belsize Park?

Oh, I never!

All right then what about 8a Woodford Square?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You say anything about that and I'll do you for treason.

JOHN CLEESE:
M'lud if we could continue ...

TERRY JONES:
He's got a Chinese bit there.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, that's contempt of court.

TERRY JONES:
It was only a joke.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Contempt of court. However, I'm not going to punish you, because we're so short of judges at the moment, what with all of them emigrating to South Africa. I'm going tomorrow; I've got my ticket. Get out there and get some decent sentencing done. Ooh, England makes you sick. Best I can manage here is life imprisonment. It's hardly worth coming in in the morning. Now, South Africa? You've got your cat of nine tails, you've got four death sentences a week, you've got cheap drinks, slave labour and a booming stock market. I'm off, I tell you. Yes, I'm up to here with probation and bleeding psychiatric reports. That's it, I'm off. That's it. Right. But I'm going to have one final fling before I leave, so I sentence you to be burnt at the stake.

TERRY JONES:
Blimey! I didn't expect the Spanish Inquisition.

DIRECTION:
Court reacts expectantly. Cut to suburban house. The three members of the Spanish Inquisition suddenly belt out of the door and down the path. Dick Barton music. Cut to them leaping onto a bus.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Two, er, three to the Old Bailey please.

Credits start superimposed.

Look they've started the credits.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

Come on hurry. Hurry!

We see shots of them coming through London.

MICHAEL PALIN:
There's the lighting credit, only five left.

DIRECTION:
more shots of the bus going through London; the credits reach the producer

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hell, it's the producer - quick!

DIRECTION:
They leap off the bus into the Old Bailey. Cut to court room. They burst in.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Nobody expects the Spa...

DIRECTION:
'The End' appears

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh bugger!
