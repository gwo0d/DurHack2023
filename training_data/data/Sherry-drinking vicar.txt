MICHAEL PALIN:
Come in.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I wondered if I could have a word with you for a moment.

MICHAEL PALIN:
By all means ... by all means, sir. Do sit down.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah, sit on the desk here.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Thank you.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Now then, a glass of sherry?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No... no thank you...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Are you sure? I'm going to have some.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, if you're having some, yes then, perhaps, vicar.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh... well there's only just enough for me.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well in that case I won't, don't worry.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You see, if I split what's left, there'd be hardly any left for me at all.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, I'm not a great sherry drinker.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good! So, I can have it all ... now then what's the problem?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, just recently I've begun to worry about...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah! I've found another bottle! You can have some now if you want to.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well... yes, perhaps a little...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh you don't have to. I can drink the whole bottle.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well in that case, no...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good! That's another bottle for me. Do go on.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I've begun to worry recently that...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Come in!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah, Mr Husband ... this is Mr Kirkham, one of my parishioners, this is Mr Husband of the British Sherry Corporation...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Look, look, perhaps I'd better come back later...

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, no ... no do stay here. Have a sherry... you won't be long will you, Husband?

ERIC IDLE:
Oh no, vicar... it's just a question of signing a few forms.

MICHAEL PALIN:
There we are... there we are, Mr Husband. Now, how about you, Mr Kirkham?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well only if there's enough.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh well, there's not much now.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, in that case... no... I won't bother.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good. Right... now, then, what is the problem, Husband?

ERIC IDLE:
Well, vicar, I've made enquiries with our shippers and the most sherry they can ship in any one load is 12,000 gallons.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And how many glasses is that?

ERIC IDLE:
That's roughly 540,000 glasses, Vicar.

MICHAEL PALIN:
That's excellent, Husband, excellent.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes... it means you can still keep your main sherry supply on the roof, but you can have an emergency supply underneath the vestry of 5,000 gallons.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes... and I could have dry sherry on the roof and Amontillado in the underground tank!

ERIC IDLE:
Absolutely.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Excellent work, Husband, excellent work.

ERIC IDLE:
Not at all, vicar, you're one of our best customers... you and the United States. Well goodbye.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Terrific. Now then, Mr Kirkham

MICHAEL PALIN:
I am so sorry... do go on.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, it's just that recently I've begun to worry about...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, look...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I sometimes ask myself - does the Bible intend...

TERRY JONES:
What did you want?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Dirty books, please.

MICHAEL PALIN:
E. Henry Thripshaw t-shirts are now available from BBC Enterprises. The price hasn't finally been decided, and the address to write to...they haven't yet quite worked out.
