Cut to a housewife in a back garden standing in front of a washing line with really nasty stained washing on it: some man's trousers with very nasty stain on crotch and running down the leg, a badly torn sheet with melted chocolate bisquit stuck on it, a huge bra, with cups eighteen inches across, two pieces of streaky bacon and a fried egg pegged on the line, and more dirty washing.

Cut to a property developer in a main street.
