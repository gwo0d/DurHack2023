DIRECTION:
Cut to a sitting room. Low sexy lighting - ha ha - soft sexy music. On the sofa are Victor and Iris just beginning to make passes at each other.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Would you mind terribly if I hold your hand?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh no, no, not at all.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh Iris, you're so very beautiful.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh, do you really mean that?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I do, I do, I do. I think... I'm beginning to fall in love with you.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh Victor.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It's silly isn't it?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
No, no, not at all dear sweet Victor.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No I didn't mean that. Only just us being so close together for so many months in the soft-toy department and yet never daring to...

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh, oh Victor.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh Iris.

DIRECTION:
they move closer to kiss; just before their lips meet the doorbell rings

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Who can that be?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh, well you try and get rid of them.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes I will, I will.

DIRECTION:
Victor opens the front door. Arthur Name is standing outside the door.

ERIC IDLE:
Hello!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Hello.

ERIC IDLE:
Remember me?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No I'm...

ERIC IDLE:
In the pub. The tall thin one with the moustache, remember? About three years ago?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, I don't I'm afraid.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, blimey, it's dark in here,

DIRECTION:
switches light on

ERIC IDLE:
that's better. Only you said we must have a drink together sometime, so I thought I'd take you up on it as the film society meeting was cancelled this evening.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Look, to be frank, it is a little awkward this evening.

DIRECTION:
stepping in; to Iris

ERIC IDLE:
Hello, I'm Arthur. Arthur Name. Name by name but not by nature. I always say that, don't I Vicky boy?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Really...

DIRECTION:
to Victor

ERIC IDLE:
Is that your wife?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Er, no, actually.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, I get the picture. Eh? Well don't worry about me Vicky boy, I know all about one-night stands.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I beg your pardon?

ERIC IDLE:
Mind if I change the record?

DIRECTION:
takes the record off

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Look, look, we put that on.

ERIC IDLE:
Here's a good one, I heard it in a pub. What's brown, what's brown and sounds like a bell?

ERIC IDLE:
What's brown and sounds like a bell? Dung! Ha, ha, ha, that's a good one. I like that one, I won't keep you long.

DIRECTION:
the gramophone plays the 'Liberty Bell March' very loud

ERIC IDLE:
That's better, now don't worry about me. I'll wait here till you've finished.

DIRECTION:
The doorbell rings again.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Who the hell...

ERIC IDLE:
I'll get it. It'll be friends of mine. I took the liberty of inviting them along.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Look, we were hoping to have a quiet evening on our own.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, they won't mind. They're very broad-minded. Hello!

DIRECTION:
He opens the door; Mr and Mrs Equator walk in and go straight up to Victor.

JOHN CLEESE:
Good evening. My name is Equator, Mr Equator Equator. Like round the middle of the Earth, only with an L.

DIRECTION:
wheezing laugh

JOHN CLEESE:
This is my wife Audrey, she smells a bit but she has a heart of gold.

TERRY JONES:
Hello, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
There must have been some kind of misunderstanding, because this is not the...

JOHN CLEESE:
Who's that then?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What?

JOHN CLEESE:
Who's the bird?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'm...

JOHN CLEESE:
You got a nice pair there haven't you love.

DIRECTION:
puts hand on Iris's boobs and gives a wet kiss; Iris screams

JOHN CLEESE:
Shut up you silly bitch, it was only a bit of fun.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Now look here ...

JOHN CLEESE:
Big gin please.

ERIC IDLE:
I'll get it.

DIRECTION:
going after Arthur

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Look, leave those drinks alone.

TERRY JONES:
And three tins of beans for me please.

JOHN CLEESE:
I told you to lay off the beans, you whore!

TERRY JONES:
I only want three cans.

JOHN CLEESE:
Button your lip you rat-bag.

DIRECTION:
laughs uproariously

DIRECTION:
joins in

TERRY JONES:
Ha, ha, ha, ha...

JOHN CLEESE:
It was rather witty, wasn't it? Where's my gin?

DIRECTION:
The doorbell rings again

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Who the hell's that?

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, I took the liberty of inviting an old friend along, as his wife has just passed away, and he's somewhat distraught poor chap. I hope you don't mind.

DIRECTION:
opening door

ERIC IDLE:
Come on in.

DIRECTION:
In walks Mr Freight in underpants, sequins, eye make-up, white wellies, and necklace.

TERRY GILLIAM:
Oh? My God, what a simply ghastly place.

JOHN CLEESE:
Not too good is it? A pint of cr√®me de menthe for my friend. Well how are you, you great poof?

DIRECTION:
sits down

DIRECTION:
throws it into fire

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Aaaagh! Boo boo hooo.

TERRY GILLIAM:
I've asked along a simply gorgeous little man I picked up outside the Odeon.

JOHN CLEESE:
Is he sexy?

DIRECTION:
In walks Mr Cook with a goat. Freight kisses him.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I had to bring the goat, he's not well. I only hope he don't go on the carpet.

DIRECTION:
to Iris

JOHN CLEESE:
Come on then love, drop 'em.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Aaaaaaagh!

DIRECTION:
runs out

JOHN CLEESE:
Blimey, she don't go much do she.

DIRECTION:
He sits in chair which collapses.

TERRY JONES:
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, oooooh! I've wet 'em

MICHAEL PALIN:
The goat's just done a bundle.

DIRECTION:
A group of singers run on, dressed as Welsh miners. All talk at once.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Look, get out all of you. Go on. Get out! Get out!

JOHN CLEESE:
I beg your pardon?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'm turning you all out. I'm not having my house filled with filthy perverts, now look, I'm giving you just half a minute then I'm going to call the police, so get out.

JOHN CLEESE:
I don't much like the tone of your voice.

DIRECTION:

JOHN CLEESE:
Right let's have a ding dong...

Ding dong merrily on high, in Heaven the bells are ringing etc...
