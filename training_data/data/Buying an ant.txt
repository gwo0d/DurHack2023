ERIC IDLE:
Hello? Hello?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, I'm terribly sorry...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I thought you were someone else.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh I see, yes.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'm sorry sir, can I help you?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, yes, as a matter of fact you can, actually I was interested in the possibility... of purchasing one of your ... can I ask who you thought I was?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What?

ERIC IDLE:
Who did you think I was... just then... when you thought I was somebody.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, it's no one you'd know, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
Well I might know them.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It's possible, obviously, but I think it's really unlikely.

ERIC IDLE:
Well, I know quite a lot...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I mean he's hardly likely to move in your circles, sir...

ERIC IDLE:
Why, is he very

ERIC IDLE:
?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, no, I didn't mean that, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
Is he a lord or something?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, no, not at all.

ERIC IDLE:
Well look, this is very easy to settle. What is his name?.

ERIC IDLE:
What is his name?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well... er...

ERIC IDLE:
Yes?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Michael Ellis.

ERIC IDLE:
Who?

ERIC IDLE:
I see.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Do you know him, sir?

ERIC IDLE:
Er ... Michael Ellis. Michael Ellis...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You don't

ERIC IDLE:
Well, I don't remember the name.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I think you would remember him, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
Why do you say that?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, would you remember a man six foot nine inches high, fortyish, and he's got a long scar from here to here and absolutely no nose?

ERIC IDLE:
... oh, I think I do remember somebody like that...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, that's not Michael Ellis.

ERIC IDLE:
What?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
He's a small man about this high with a high-pitched voice.

ERIC IDLE:
Right, I'm not going to buy an ant from you now.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, no, please.

ERIC IDLE:
No. You've not been properly trained. I demand another assistant.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, no, come on... please...

ERIC IDLE:
No, I want

ERIC IDLE:
.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
All right! I'll get another assistant.

ERIC IDLE:
Thank you.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Hello sir, can I help you, sir?

ERIC IDLE:
No, I want a

ERIC IDLE:
assistant.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
sir, I'm Mr Abanazar, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
Don't be silly.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh no, please please please let me help you...

ERIC IDLE:
No! I want another assistant.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, no, come on, please...

ERIC IDLE:
If you don't give me another assistant...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no, I'll be very good, sir, really.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Good morning, sir... how are you, sir... bit parky outside today... isn't it, sir... ? A very nice suit you've got there, sir... you had a very close shave this morning, sir...

ERIC IDLE:
Right I'm going!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no, please...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Woooooo ....ooooooo...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It's not him!

ERIC IDLE:
!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh please, give him a chance!

ERIC IDLE:
No!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, sir, can I be of any assistance?

ERIC IDLE:
Oh no, come on, don't try that!

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'm sorry, sir... try what?

ERIC IDLE:
You know perfectly well what I mean.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'm afraid I don't, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
You were down behind there with a silly mask on going wooo-ooo...

MICHAEL PALIN:
I don't think I was, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
All right, get the manager.

MICHAEL PALIN:
There seems to have been some sort of misunderstanding, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
Manager!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
This is the manager, sir.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, I'm the manager.

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's a smashing store this, I can't recommend it too highly, well-lit, rat-free. It's a joy to manage. Oh yes, the freshest haddock in London, second floor, third floor Ribena, ants here, television and flame throwers over there, behind them our dinner-wagon exhibition closes at six...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Quick!

TERRY JONES:
Yes, sir? Can I help you, sir?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, I want to complain about the assistants on this counter.

TERRY JONES:
I'm sorry to hear that, sir, which ones?

ERIC IDLE:
Well, they're hiding now.

TERRY JONES:
Sir?

ERIC IDLE:
They're hiding, down there behind the counter.

TERRY JONES:
I see, sir.

TERRY JONES:
... well... there's nobody down here, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
They must have crawled through here, and made their escape through 'Soft Toys'.

TERRY JONES:
Yes, of course.

ERIC IDLE:
They were wearing masks and making silly noises and one of them pretended to be the manager. He spoke like this..

TERRY JONES:
Ah! I think I've got it, sir, I think I've got it! It's rag week.

ERIC IDLE:
Ragweek?

TERRY JONES:
Yes, you know, for charity, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh! I see. Some local college or university?

TERRY JONES:
No, no it's the

TERRY JONES:
rag week.

ERIC IDLE:
The

ERIC IDLE:
rag week?

TERRY JONES:
Yes. The senior staff don't join in much - it's for the trainees really...

ERIC IDLE:
It's not very good for business is it?

TERRY JONES:
Oh, It's for charity, sir. People are awfully good about it, you know.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, yes, of course.

TERRY JONES:
Right, sir, I'll get you a senior assistant - ants, was it?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, please.

TERRY JONES:
Could you look after this gentleman, Mr Snetterton?

ERIC IDLE:
I don't want him!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Give me a chance!

TERRY JONES:
All right - Mr Hartford!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes - good morning, sir - can I help you?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, please, I'm interested in buying an ant.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah yes - and what price were you thinking of paying, sir?

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, well, I hadn't actually got as far as that.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well sir, they start about half a p. but they can go as high as three p. or even three and a half p. for a champion - inflation I'm afraid...

ERIC IDLE:
Well, I should think one about one and a half p., please.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah yes, well you should get a very serviceable little animal for that, sir. Quite frankly the half pence ones are a bit on the mangy side ... What length was sir thinking of?

ERIC IDLE:
Oh ... medium?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Medium. Medium. Here we are, sir.

MICHAEL PALIN:
That one there is an Ayrshire, and that one there is a King George bitch I think ... and that one killing the little flitbat is an Afghan.

ERIC IDLE:
That's a nice one.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Let's see how you get on with him, eh?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah yes, he likes you. He's taken to you.

ERIC IDLE:
What do you feed them on?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Blancmange.

ERIC IDLE:
Blancmange?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that. No, you don't feed them at all.

ERIC IDLE:
Well, what do they live on?

MICHAEL PALIN:
They don't. They die.

ERIC IDLE:
They die?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well of course they do, if you don't feed them.

ERIC IDLE:
I don't understand.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You let them die, then you buy another one. It's much cheaper than feeding them and that way you have a constant variety of little companions.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, I see.

MICHAEL PALIN:
That's the advantage of owning an ant.

ERIC IDLE:
Right, well I'll take this one. Oh dear, I've dropped it...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Never mind. Here's another one.

ERIC IDLE:
Is there anything else I'll need?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, sir - you'll need an ant house.

MICHAEL PALIN:
This is the model we recommend, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
Won't it get out of there?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes.

ERIC IDLE:
Well what's the point of having the cage?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, none at all really. And then some pieces of cage furniture which will keep him entertained.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Here's an ant-wheel, ant-swing, and a very nice one here, a little ladder - he can run up there and ring the bell at the top, that's a little trick he can learn.

ERIC IDLE:
Will he live long enough?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Not really, no, but it's best to have one just in case, and here's a two-way radio he can play with... and of course you'll need the book.

ERIC IDLE:
The book?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, the book on ants.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes...

MICHAEL PALIN:
So, sir, that is, if I may say so, one hundred and eighty-four pounds one and a half p., sir.

ERIC IDLE:
Will you take a cheque?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, sir, if you don't mind leaving a blood-sample, and a piece of skin off the back of the scalp just here, sir ...

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, well I think I'll put it on account.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I should, sir... much less painful. Anyway sir, you know what they say about an ant. A friend for life, eh? Well, a friend for its life anyway...

MICHAEL PALIN:
If the little chap should go to an early grave, sir, give us a ring and we'll stick a few in an envelope, all right?

ERIC IDLE:
Thanks very much indeed.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Not at all, thank

MICHAEL PALIN:
, Mr Ellis.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Sssssshh!

ERIC IDLE:
What did you say?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I said thank you, Mr Ellis...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It's not him.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh!

ERIC IDLE:
Why did you say I was Mr Ellis?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Who?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, he didn't say that.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes he did. I heard him say 'Thank you, Mr Ellis'.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, no, no - he said 'I'm jealous'.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'm jealous of your ant. Goodbye. Goodbye.

ERIC IDLE:
I don't care who Michael Ellis is!
