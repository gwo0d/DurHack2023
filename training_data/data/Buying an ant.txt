ERIC IDLE:
Hello? Hello?

DIRECTION:
A strange rubber-masked head appears from below the other side of the counter and gesticulates at him making a strange noise. This soon stops.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, I'm terribly sorry...

DIRECTION:
he takes off the mask to reveal a straight forward assistant

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I thought you were someone else.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh I see, yes.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'm sorry sir, can I help you?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, yes, as a matter of fact you can, actually I was interested in the possibility... of purchasing one of your ... can I ask who you thought I was?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What?

ERIC IDLE:
Who did you think I was... just then... when you thought I was somebody.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, it's no one you'd know, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
Well I might know them.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It's possible, obviously, but I think it's really unlikely.

ERIC IDLE:
Well, I know quite a lot...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I mean he's hardly likely to move in your circles, sir...

ERIC IDLE:
Why, is he very

DIRECTION:
rich

ERIC IDLE:
?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, no, I didn't mean that, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
Is he a lord or something?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, no, not at all.

ERIC IDLE:
Well look, this is very easy to settle. What is his name?.

ERIC IDLE:
What is his name?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well... er...

ERIC IDLE:
Yes?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Michael Ellis.

ERIC IDLE:
Who?

ERIC IDLE:
I see.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Do you know him, sir?

ERIC IDLE:
Er ... Michael Ellis. Michael Ellis...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You don't

ERIC IDLE:
Well, I don't remember the name.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I think you would remember him, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
Why do you say that?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, would you remember a man six foot nine inches high, fortyish, and he's got a long scar from here to here and absolutely no nose?

ERIC IDLE:
... oh, I think I do remember somebody like that...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, that's not Michael Ellis.

ERIC IDLE:
What?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
He's a small man about this high with a high-pitched voice.

ERIC IDLE:
Right, I'm not going to buy an ant from you now.

DIRECTION:
distressed

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, no, please.

ERIC IDLE:
No. You've not been properly trained. I demand another assistant.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, no, come on... please...

ERIC IDLE:
No, I want

DIRECTION:
another assistant

ERIC IDLE:
.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
All right! I'll get another assistant.

DIRECTION:
he disappears behind a curtain

ERIC IDLE:
Thank you.

DIRECTION:
The same assistant reappears with a long mandarin-style Chinese moustache.

DIRECTION:
high-pitched voice

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Hello sir, can I help you, sir?

ERIC IDLE:
No, I want a

DIRECTION:
different

ERIC IDLE:
assistant.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I

DIRECTION:
am

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
sir, I'm Mr Abanazar, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
Don't be silly.

DIRECTION:
normal voice

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh no, please please please let me help you...

ERIC IDLE:
No! I want another assistant.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, no, come on, please...

ERIC IDLE:
If you don't give me another assistant...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no, I'll be very good, sir, really.

DIRECTION:
he becomes exaggeratedly polite

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Good morning, sir... how are you, sir... bit parky outside today... isn't it, sir... ? A very nice suit you've got there, sir... you had a very close shave this morning, sir...

ERIC IDLE:
Right I'm going!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no, please...

DIRECTION:
he takes off his moustache

DIRECTION:
he rings the bell on the counter.

DIRECTION:
After a pause, very slowly indeed an identical mask to the first appears over the top of the counter right next to the first assistant, making the same noise very quietly. The first assistant sees him, starts and nudges him hard.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Woooooo ....ooooooo...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It's not him!

DIRECTION:
The second assistant makes a disappointed noise and disappears below.

DIRECTION:
pointing over the counter at the disappeared assistant

DIRECTION:
him

ERIC IDLE:
!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh please, give him a chance!

ERIC IDLE:
No!

DIRECTION:
appearing from below counter without a mask, looking immaculate

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, sir, can I be of any assistance?

ERIC IDLE:
Oh no, come on, don't try that!

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'm sorry, sir... try what?

ERIC IDLE:
You know perfectly well what I mean.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'm afraid I don't, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
You were down behind there with a silly mask on going wooo-ooo...

MICHAEL PALIN:
I don't think I was, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
All right, get the manager.

MICHAEL PALIN:
There seems to have been some sort of misunderstanding, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
Manager!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
This is the manager, sir.

DIRECTION:
in a silly voice

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, I'm the manager.

DIRECTION:
he keeps calling

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's a smashing store this, I can't recommend it too highly, well-lit, rat-free. It's a joy to manage. Oh yes, the freshest haddock in London, second floor, third floor Ribena, ants here, television and flame throwers over there, behind them our dinner-wagon exhibition closes at six...

DIRECTION:
nudging him

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Quick!

DIRECTION:
They both disappear under the counter. The real manager arrives and presents himself to Chris.

TERRY JONES:
Yes, sir? Can I help you, sir?

DIRECTION:
noticing the 'manager' badge on his lapel

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, I want to complain about the assistants on this counter.

TERRY JONES:
I'm sorry to hear that, sir, which ones?

ERIC IDLE:
Well, they're hiding now.

TERRY JONES:
Sir?

ERIC IDLE:
They're hiding, down there behind the counter.

TERRY JONES:
I see, sir.

DIRECTION:
he goes round counter, looks, but obviously can't see them; Chris goes round to join in the search

TERRY JONES:
... well... there's nobody down here, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
They must have crawled through here, and made their escape through 'Soft Toys'.

DIRECTION:
he points

TERRY JONES:
Yes, of course.

ERIC IDLE:
They were wearing masks and making silly noises and one of them pretended to be the manager. He spoke like this..

DIRECTION:
he does an impression

TERRY JONES:
Ah! I think I've got it, sir, I think I've got it! It's rag week.

ERIC IDLE:
Ragweek?

TERRY JONES:
Yes, you know, for charity, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh! I see. Some local college or university?

TERRY JONES:
No, no it's the

DIRECTION:
store's

TERRY JONES:
rag week.

ERIC IDLE:
The

DIRECTION:
store's

ERIC IDLE:
rag week?

TERRY JONES:
Yes. The senior staff don't join in much - it's for the trainees really...

ERIC IDLE:
It's not very good for business is it?

TERRY JONES:
Oh, It's for charity, sir. People are awfully good about it, you know.

DIRECTION:
he rattles a collecting tin

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, yes, of course.

DIRECTION:
he puts a coin in

TERRY JONES:
Right, sir, I'll get you a senior assistant - ants, was it?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, please.

DIRECTION:
calling

DIRECTION:
Mr Snetterton approaches immediately; he is clearly the first assistant with very bad short crew-cut wig on

TERRY JONES:
Could you look after this gentleman, Mr Snetterton?

ERIC IDLE:
I don't want him!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh

DIRECTION:
please!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Give me a chance!

TERRY JONES:
All right - Mr Hartford!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes - good morning, sir - can I help you?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, please, I'm interested in buying an ant.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah yes - and what price were you thinking of paying, sir?

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, well, I hadn't actually got as far as that.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well sir, they start about half a p. but they can go as high as three p. or even three and a half p. for a champion - inflation I'm afraid...

ERIC IDLE:
Well, I should think one about one and a half p., please.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah yes, well you should get a very serviceable little animal for that, sir. Quite frankly the half pence ones are a bit on the mangy side ... What length was sir thinking of?

ERIC IDLE:
Oh ... medium?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Medium. Medium. Here we are, sir.

DIRECTION:
he tips some ants - which we can't see - out into a special ring on counter

MICHAEL PALIN:
That one there is an Ayrshire, and that one there is a King George bitch I think ... and that one killing the little flitbat is an Afghan.

ERIC IDLE:
That's a nice one.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Let's see how you get on with him, eh?

DIRECTION:
he puts it on Chris's hand

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah yes, he likes you. He's taken to you.

ERIC IDLE:
What do you feed them on?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Blancmange.

ERIC IDLE:
Blancmange?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that. No, you don't feed them at all.

ERIC IDLE:
Well, what do they live on?

MICHAEL PALIN:
They don't. They die.

ERIC IDLE:
They die?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well of course they do, if you don't feed them.

ERIC IDLE:
I don't understand.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You let them die, then you buy another one. It's much cheaper than feeding them and that way you have a constant variety of little companions.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, I see.

MICHAEL PALIN:
That's the advantage of owning an ant.

ERIC IDLE:
Right, well I'll take this one. Oh dear, I've dropped it...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Never mind. Here's another one.

ERIC IDLE:
Is there anything else I'll need?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, sir - you'll need an ant house.

DIRECTION:
he produces a birdcage

MICHAEL PALIN:
This is the model we recommend, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
Won't it get out of there?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes.

ERIC IDLE:
Well what's the point of having the cage?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, none at all really. And then some pieces of cage furniture which will keep him entertained.

DIRECTION:
he produces microscopic things

MICHAEL PALIN:
Here's an ant-wheel, ant-swing, and a very nice one here, a little ladder - he can run up there and ring the bell at the top, that's a little trick he can learn.

ERIC IDLE:
Will he live long enough?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Not really, no, but it's best to have one just in case, and here's a two-way radio he can play with... and of course you'll need the book.

DIRECTION:
he produces an expensive-looking book, thoughtlessly slams it down where the ants were, then hurriedly brushes them away

ERIC IDLE:
The book?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, the book on ants.

DIRECTION:
looking unsure

ERIC IDLE:
Yes...

MICHAEL PALIN:
So, sir, that is, if I may say so, one hundred and eighty-four pounds one and a half p., sir.

ERIC IDLE:
Will you take a cheque?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, sir, if you don't mind leaving a blood-sample, and a piece of skin off the back of the scalp just here, sir ...

DIRECTION:
indicates a point behind his ear

DIRECTION:
he hands him a little knife and some cotton wool

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, well I think I'll put it on account.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I should, sir... much less painful. Anyway sir, you know what they say about an ant. A friend for life, eh? Well, a friend for its life anyway...

DIRECTION:
Hartford loads the large cage, furniture, two-way radio and the book on ants into a huge box; with some difficulty he finds the ant; he picks it up carefully

DIRECTION:
he drops him in the big box and pushes it across the counter; the box has on one side, in large letters 'live ant: handle with care'; it has breathing holes in it

MICHAEL PALIN:
If the little chap should go to an early grave, sir, give us a ring and we'll stick a few in an envelope, all right?

ERIC IDLE:
Thanks very much indeed.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Not at all, thank

DIRECTION:
you

MICHAEL PALIN:
, Mr Ellis.

DIRECTION:
Chris turns sharply. The first assistant comes quickly up to Hartford.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Sssssshh!

ERIC IDLE:
What did you say?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I said thank you, Mr Ellis...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It's not him.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh!

ERIC IDLE:
Why did you say I was Mr Ellis?

DIRECTION:
innocently

MICHAEL PALIN:
Who?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, he didn't say that.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes he did. I heard him say 'Thank you, Mr Ellis'.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, no, no - he said 'I'm jealous'.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'm jealous of your ant. Goodbye. Goodbye.

DIRECTION:
waves pointedly

DIRECTION:
leaving the counter

ERIC IDLE:
I don't care who Michael Ellis is!

DIRECTION:
Chris passes a shop area labelled 'The Paisley Counter' where two customers are talking to mirrors in thick Irish accents. Chris moves on to lift. A little old lady passes, oblivious to the fact that her shopping trolley is smouldering. The lady passes and Chris is about to enter.

DIRECTION:
Will Mr Michael Ellis please go straight to the manager's office... I'll repeat that...

DIRECTION:
Chris wheels round and listens

DIRECTION:
Will Mr Nigel Mellish please go straight to the manager's office.
