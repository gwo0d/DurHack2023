CAPTION: 'THE BEGINNINGS'

DIRECTION:
Cut to a suburban bathroom. A plumber with a bag of tools open beside him is doing an elaborate repair on the toilet. He is in rather an awkward position.

DIRECTION:
working away

DIRECTION:
struggling with the work

MICHAEL PALIN:
come on... come on... momentous ascent, the brothers took one last look at their craft, as it stood on the field of Annencay.

DIRECTION:
Pleasant elegant eighteenth-century music. Mix to a French small country-house interior. At the window Joseph and Jacques Montgolfier are looking out at their balloon. In the background a plumber is working away at a bit of eighteenth-century French piping.

ERIC IDLE:
This is a great moment for us, Joseph.

TERRY JONES:
It is a great moment for France.

ERIC IDLE:
Ah, oui!

TERRY JONES:
First ascent in a hot-air balloon, by the Montgolfier brothers - 1783 ... I can see us now... just after Montesquieu and just before Mozart.

ERIC IDLE:
I think I'll go and wash ...

TERRY JONES:
Good luck.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh ... it's quite easy, really ... I just slap a little water on my face, then...

TERRY JONES:
No... good luck for tomorrow.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh I see, yes. You too. Yours has been the work.

TERRY JONES:
Let us hope for a safe ascent... and don't use my flannel.

ERIC IDLE:
You know, when you showed me the plans in Paris, I could not believe that we should be the first men who would fly.

TERRY JONES:
Yes ... it's wonderful.

ERIC IDLE:
I am so excited I could hardly wash.

TERRY JONES:
Yes ... I too have had some difficulty washing these past few days.

ERIC IDLE:
Still, what is washing when we are on the verge of a great scientific breakthrough?

TERRY JONES:
Jacques...

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, Joseph...

TERRY JONES:
I have not been washing very thoroughly for many years now.

ERIC IDLE:
What do you mean? You must have been washing your face?

TERRY JONES:
Oh yes, my face, I wash my face... but my legs... my stomach ... my chest, they're filthy.

ERIC IDLE:
Well, I don't wash my stomach every day.

DIRECTION:
with increasing self-remorse

TERRY JONES:
Ah, but you wash far more than me ... you are the cleaner of the Montgolfier brothers.

ERIC IDLE:
This is nothing, Joseph...

DIRECTION:
A very formal butler enters.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Monsieur Montgolfier.. A Mr Parfitt to see you, sir.

DIRECTION:
A head appears round the door and corrects the butler, in a very stage whisper.

DIRECTION:
No, no... no... Bartlett!

DIRECTION:
the head disappears again

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
A Mr Barklit, to see you, sir.

DIRECTION:
No! Bartlett with a 't'.

DIRECTION:
with difficulty

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Barr ... at ... elett ... to see you, sir.

DIRECTION:
Bartlett

DIRECTION:
he disappears again

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Barkit...

DIRECTION:
Bartlett!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Baffle... Bartlett... A Mr Bartl

DIRECTION:
ett

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
to see you, sir.

TERRY JONES:
I don't want to see anyone, O'Toole... tell him to go away.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Thank you, sir.

DIRECTION:
he exits

ERIC IDLE:
Well, it's getting late. I must go and have a wash.

TERRY JONES:
What will you be washing?

ERIC IDLE:
Oh ... just my face and neck ... perhaps my feet... and possibly ... but no ... no ... lock up the plans, Joseph... tomorrow they will make us the toast of France. 'The first ascent by the Montgolfier brothers in a balloon'. Just after Ballcock and just before Bang... what a position!

DIRECTION:
Some men have now entered the room, chosen a spot and are briskly but quietly setting up a screen and a projector, The projector is turned on and a film comes up on the screen together with triumphant music, applause and commentary. We zoom in to the screen. It shows an animation of two naked men boxing in a large tub of water.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
So, on June 7th, 1783, the Montgolfier brothers had a really good wash ... starting on his face and arms, Joseph Michael Montgolfier went on to scrub his torso, his legs and his naughty bits, before rinsing his whole body. That June night, he and his brother between them washed seventeen square feet of body area. They used a kilo and a half of catholic soap and nearly fourteen gallons of nice hot water. It was indeed an impressive sight.

DIRECTION:
Music crescendo.

DIRECTION:
This is over the BBC 2 logo.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Next week on 'The Golden Age of Ballooning', we examine the work of Girlsher and Coxwell, the English balloonists who ascended to a height of seven miles in 1862 without washing. There is also a book called 'The Golden Age of Ballooning' published by the BBC to coincide with the series. It's in an attractive hand-tooled binding, is priced £5 and failure to buy it will make you liable to a £50 fine or three months' imprisonment. There's also a record of someone reading the book of 'The Golden Age of Ballooning', a crochet-work bedspread with the words 'The Golden Age of Ballooning' on it, available from the BBC, price £18 or five months' imprisonment and there are matching toilet-seat covers and courtesy mats with illustrations of many of the baboons mentioned. Also available is a life-size model frog which croaks the words 'The Golden Age of Ballooning' and an attractive bakelite case for storing motorway construction plans in, made in the shape of a balloon. And now, another chance to see a repeat of this morning's re-run of last night's second showing of episode two of the award-winning series 'The Golden Age of Ballooning'.

CAPTION: 'NOT WITH EACH OTHER, OBVIOUSLY'

DIRECTION:
Joseph Montgolfier's workshop. We see plans and drawing boards, and at one end of the room, Joseph's fiancee, Antoinette, in a pretty dress. She is hanging suspended in a harness horizontally, attached to a gas bag. In other words she is fioating like the bottom half of an airship. Joseph is making calculations excitedly. Occasionally he goes over to her, takes a measurement and goes back to his desk to write it down.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh Joseph, all you think about is balloons... all you talk about is balloons. Your beautiful house is full of bits and pieces of balloons... your books are all about balloons... every time you sing a song, it is in some way obliquely connected with balloons... everything you eat has to have 'balloon' incorporated in the title... your dogs are an called 'balloonno'... you tie balloons to your ankles in the evenings.

TERRY JONES:
I don't do that!

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Well, no, you don't do that, but you do duck down and shout 'Hey! Balloons!' when there are none about. Your whole life is becoming obsessively balloonic, you know. Why do I have to hang from this bloody gas bag all day? Don't I mean anything to you?

DIRECTION:
busy measuring

TERRY JONES:
Oh ma cherie, you mean more to me than any heavier than air dirigible could ever...

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh there you go again!

TERRY JONES:
Don't waggle!

DIRECTION:
Jacques enters.

ERIC IDLE:
I've run your bath for you, Joseph.

DIRECTION:
he sees Antoinette

ERIC IDLE:
Oh... I'm so sorry, I didn't realize.

TERRY JONES:
It's all right, we've done the difficult bit.

ERIC IDLE:
Well, don't forget we have our special guest coming this evening.

TERRY JONES:
Oh?

ERIC IDLE:
Don't tell me you have forgotten already. The man who is giving us thousands of francs for our experiments.

TERRY JONES:
What man?

ERIC IDLE:
Louis XIV!

TERRY JONES:
Isn't he dead?

ERIC IDLE:
Evidently not...

TERRY JONES:
All right, I'll be round.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, and Joseph...

TERRY JONES:
Yes, Jacques?

ERIC IDLE:
You will... wash... won't you?

TERRY JONES:
Yes, of course!

DIRECTION:
CAPTION: 'LATER THAT EVENING'

DIRECTION:
Fade up on the Montgolfiers' sitting room. Jacques sits there rather nervously. The plumber is working away. The door opens and the butler appears.
