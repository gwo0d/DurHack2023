ERIC IDLE:
Burglar!

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes?

ERIC IDLE:
Burglar, madam.

JOHN CLEESE:
What do you want?

ERIC IDLE:
I want to come in and steal a few things, madam.

JOHN CLEESE:
Are you an encydopaedia salesman?

ERIC IDLE:
No madam, I'm a burglar, I burgle people.

JOHN CLEESE:
I think you're an encyclopaedia salesman.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh I'm not, open the door, let me in please.

JOHN CLEESE:
If I let you in you'll sell me encyclopaedias.

ERIC IDLE:
I won't, madam. I just want to come in and ransack the flat. Honestly.

JOHN CLEESE:
Promise. No encyclopaedias?

ERIC IDLE:
None at all.

JOHN CLEESE:
All right.

JOHN CLEESE:
You'd better come in then.

ERIC IDLE:
Mind you I don't know whether you've really considered the advantages of owning a really fine set of modern encyclopaedias...

ERIC IDLE:
You know, they can really do you wonders.

MICHAEL PALIN:
That man was a successful encyclopaedia salesman. But not all encyclopaedia salesmen are successful. Here is an unsuccessful encyclopaedia salesman.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Now here are two unsuccessful encyclopaedia salesmen.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I think there's a lesson there for all of us.
