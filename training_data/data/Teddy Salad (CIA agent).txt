ERIC IDLE:
Oh, hello. My name's Carpenter. I'm from the US Government.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Are you from the army?

ERIC IDLE:
Er... no... I'm... er... I'm... I'm from the ballet. The US Government Ballet.

DIRECTION:
The lumberjack's eyes light up.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
The ballet! The ballet's coming here?

ERIC IDLE:
Well maybe...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, that's great! We love the ballet. Last year some of us from Yellow River got a party to go see the ballet in Montreal.

DIRECTION:
Dimly we can see behind the lumberjack a bevy of beautiful boys of all nations.

ERIC IDLE:
Look, I was wondering...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, we had a

DIRECTION:
marvellous

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
time. It was Margot Fonteyn dancing 'Les Sylphides'... oh, it was so beautiful...

ERIC IDLE:
Do you know...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Do you know how old she is?

ERIC IDLE:
Who?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Margot Fonteyn.

ERIC IDLE:
No.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
She's 206!

ERIC IDLE:
Look, I hear there's a US

DIRECTION:
ballet

ERIC IDLE:
organizer round these parts by the name of Teddy Salad.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You mean the special agent?

ERIC IDLE:
Well...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
He's an ex-CIA man. He's not a ballet dancer.

DIRECTION:
Laughter from the boys in the hut.

ERIC IDLE:
Well, I just want to see him on some ballet business...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, you could try the store...

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, thank you.

DIRECTION:
he turns to go

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Hey! Can you get us Lionel Blair's autograph?

DIRECTION:
Carpenter walks away.

MICHAEL PALIN:
While precious time was being lost in Canada, the seconds were ticking away for the free world...

DIRECTION:
Jarring chord. Cut to Neutron's house. He is hanging flowery print wallpaper in his sitting room. Helping him is the quite enormously vast Frank Smailes who stands rather helplessly looking up at Neutron who is on a plank between two ladders.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Already Neutron - who, you will remember, is infinitely the most dangerous man in the world, he

DIRECTION:
really

MICHAEL PALIN:
is - was gathering allies together.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Try having an omelette for your evening meal... perhaps with yogurt and grapefruit.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, I've tried that ... I once got down to fifty-six stone. But I couldn't stay like that. I used to take potatoes wherever I went. I used to go to the cinema with three hundredweight of King Edwards, I'd eat 'em all before I got out of the toilet. I had to go on to bread.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What about salad?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Teddy Salad?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no, no - salad - as in lettuces, radishes, cucumber...

DIRECTION:
Cut to Carpenter in a log cabin trading post with trestle tables. Six Eskimos are sitting in a group at one end of the other tables. An Italian chef in a long white apron and greasy shirt, is standing over Carpenter. Carpenter sits at one table with a huge fresh salad in front of him.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You don't like it?

ERIC IDLE:
No, I didn't want to

DIRECTION:
eat

ERIC IDLE:
a salad. I wanted to find out about a man called Salad.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You're the first person to order a salad for two years. All the Eskimos eat here is fish, fish ...

DIRECTION:
very British accent

DIRECTION:
not

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Eskimos.

TERRY JONES:
Where's our fish. We've finished our fish.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What fish you want today, uh?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Bream please.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Bream! Where do I get a bream this time of year? You bloody choosy Eskimo pests.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
We are

DIRECTION:
not

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Eskimos!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Why don't you like a nice plate of canelloni?

DIRECTION:
Eurrrrghhh!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
That's not fish.

DIRECTION:
as he turns to go in kitchen

MICHAEL PALIN:
I've had my lot of the Arctic Circle. I wish I was back in Oldham ...

DIRECTION:
Carpenter crosses to the Eskimos.

DIRECTION:
speaking slowly, and clearly as for foreigners

ERIC IDLE:
Do any of you Eskimos ... speak ... English?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
We're not Eskimos!

DIRECTION:
I am.

DIRECTION:
Sh!

DIRECTION:
off

MICHAEL PALIN:
Haddock!

DIRECTION:
Where?

DIRECTION:
still speaking as if to foreigners

ERIC IDLE:
Do any of... you ... know... a man ... called ... Salad?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What, Salad as in...

ERIC IDLE:
Lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes ... yes.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Like you have on your plate?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes. That's right.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, I'm afraid not.

TERRY JONES:
Where's our fish?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What does this Teddy Salad do?

ERIC IDLE:
He's a... er... hen-teaser.

DIRECTION:
Quick cut to the chairman of Fiat in his office.

ERIC IDLE:
Che cosa è la stucciacatori di polli?

DIRECTION:
SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'WHAT IS A HEN-TEASER?'

DIRECTION:
Cut back to the cabin.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, the only Teddy Salad we know is a CIA man.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, he might know.

DIRECTION:
chanting

DIRECTION:
Gunga gunga, where's our fish?

ERIC IDLE:
Where will I find him?

TERRY JONES:
Oh, he lives up at Kipper Sound.

ERIC IDLE:
Thanks a lot.

DIRECTION:
Fishy fishy iyoooiyooo.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Are you in international spying, too?

ERIC IDLE:
No... no... I'm with the... US Ballet... force... who are you with?

DIRECTION:
leans forward confidentialy

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
MI6. But not a word to the Eskimos.

DIRECTION:
Fishy fishy igooo.

DIRECTION:
The Italian chef appears.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Here's your bloody fish.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Thank you, Anouk.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'm not an Eskimo!

DIRECTION:
Cut to Arctic wastes - ice and snow and bitter blasting winds. Carpenter - his little tadger tiny as a tapir's tits - struggles on. He stops and peers ahead He sees a trapper figure with a sled pulled by four huskies. Carpenter hurries on and catches him up.

ERIC IDLE:
Hey! Hey!

DIRECTION:
The man stops. On his sled are supplies including two ladies in bikinis, deep-frozen and wrapped in cellophane bags.

ERIC IDLE:
Hi! I'm Carpenter of the US Ballet.

TERRY JONES:
Hey, great to have you around. The last decent ballet we got around here was Ballet Ramben..On Thursday they did 'Petrouchka', then on Saturday they did 'Fille Mal Gardée'. I thought it was a bit slow...

DIRECTION:
stopping him short

ERIC IDLE:
It sure is nice to see you, Mr Salad.

TERRY JONES:
I ain't Salad.

ERIC IDLE:
What?

TERRY JONES:
You want Teddy Salad?

ERIC IDLE:
Yeah ...

DIRECTION:
the man looks around rather furtively, to see if anyone is watching, then takes Carpenter's arm and indicates the dog team

ERIC IDLE:
I don't see anyone.

TERRY JONES:
The one on the end, on the right. That's Salad.

ERIC IDLE:
That's a dog!

DIRECTION:
confidentially

DIRECTION:
bits

TERRY JONES:
of it.

ERIC IDLE:
What do you mean?

TERRY JONES:
Listen, Teddy Salad is the most brilliant agent the CIA ever had, right?

ERIC IDLE:
Right.

TERRY JONES:
That's how he made his name

DIRECTION:
indicates the dog

TERRY JONES:
- disguise!

DIRECTION:
They look at the dog in silence for a moment.

ERIC IDLE:
That's incredible!

TERRY JONES:
He had to slim down to one and a half pounds to get into that costume. He cut eighteen inches off each arm and over three feet off each leg. The most brilliant surgeon in Europe stuck that tail on.

ERIC IDLE:
What about the head?

TERRY JONES:
All of the head was removed apart from the eyes and the brain in order to fit into the costume.

TERRY JONES:
D'you want to talk to him?

ERIC IDLE:
Yeah, sure.

DIRECTION:
looking around him again

TERRY JONES:
OK, let's move over to those trees over there... anyone might be watching.

DIRECTION:
They pull over to a lone deciduous tree in the middle of the empty tundra wastes. They pull in. The man goes round to the dog and kneels down beside it.

DIRECTION:
softly

TERRY JONES:
Mr Salad? ... There's Mr Carpenter to see you.

ERIC IDLE:
What does he say?

DIRECTION:
to Carpenter

DIRECTION:
Carpenter feels rather helplessly in his pockets

DIRECTION:
he produces a bone, which he gives to the dog

DIRECTION:
the dog tucks into the bone

TERRY JONES:
All right, you've got his trust, now, you can talk to him.

DIRECTION:
kneeling rather awkwardly down beside the dog, and speaking confidentially

DIRECTION:
he looks significantly at the dog, but the dog doesn't react

ERIC IDLE:
The General says you're the only one who'll know where to find him ... What's he say?

TERRY JONES:
He wants to go walkies.

ERIC IDLE:
Walkies?

TERRY JONES:
Yeah, he's right into it today - d'you mind taking him for walkies?

DIRECTION:
He gives the dog to Carpenter on a lead. Carpenter hesitates and then walks off with the dog, bending down occasionally and explaining the situation.

MICHAEL PALIN:
While Carpenter took the most brilliant agent the CIA ever had for walkies, events in the world's capitals were moving fast!

DIRECTION:
Cut to a picture of the outside of l0 Downing Street. Zoom in on the door. Music: 'Rule Britannia' type theme. Cut to interior - a few circular tables, dim lighting. The decor of a rather exclusive restaurant. Subdued murmur of upper-class people stuffing their faces. A gypsy violinist is going from table to table playing and singing. In the middle of all this there is the prime minister at a big leather-topped desk, covered with official papers, three telephones, an intercom, tape recorder, a photo of Eisenhower with a very small bunch of flowers in front of it in a sort of self-contained shrine, an in/out tray, blotter, etc. The intercom buzzes.

DIRECTION:
The Secretary of State to see you, Prime Minister.

ERIC IDLE:
Very well, show him in.

DIRECTION:
The prime minister switches off. The secretary of state enters, wending his way through the tables. He sits at the desk. He is in a rather agitated condition.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Prime Minister.

ERIC IDLE:
Do take a seat.

DIRECTION:
He takes a seat from the next table; the lady sitting on it falls to the floor.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Prime Minister, we've just had the Supreme Commander US Forces on the phone. Apparently they want a full-scale Red Alert!

ERIC IDLE:
They what?

DIRECTION:
The gypsy violinist has come round to the desk. He is playing a sad, slow melody and smiling encouragingly at them. They glance at him. He flashes a white smile. The secretary of state drops his voice and huddles closer to the prime minister.

MICHAEL PALIN:
They want a full-scale Red Alert - every troop movement...

DIRECTION:
As the secretary leans forward so does the gypsy, musing the secretary to break off in mid-sentence.

ERIC IDLE:
It's all right - don't worry about Giuseppe...

DIRECTION:
the secretary looks at the gypsy who smiles again toothily

ERIC IDLE:
He's English really.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well apparently the whole structure of world peace may be threatened unless we immediately...

DIRECTION:
heavy accent, leaning forwards

TERRY JONES:
Your anniversary, signore?

ERIC IDLE:
No, no, Giuseppe - not now.

DIRECTION:
indicating the secretary of state

TERRY JONES:
You mean zis isn't ze lady?

ERIC IDLE:
No.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, signora ... my mistake! I play for you 'My Mistake'.

DIRECTION:
before the prime minister can stop him he goes into a strident Italian song

DIRECTION:
strums violently and starts on the second verse

TERRY JONES:
'Oh my mistake...'

ERIC IDLE:
Giuseppe, do you mind playing over there.

DIRECTION:
flashing a winning smile

TERRY JONES:
Very well, signor. But I play only for you... and your beautiful companion.

DIRECTION:
He moves off mysteriously, singing the mistake song.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well anyway, this Mr Neutron, is located somewhere in the London area. We must find and exterminate him. The Americans say if we don't, they will.

DIRECTION:
straining to hear over noise of singing

ERIC IDLE:
What?

MICHAEL PALIN:
The Americans say if we won't

DIRECTION:
they

MICHAEL PALIN:
will!

ERIC IDLE:
That he doesn't know

DIRECTION:
what

ERIC IDLE:
?

MICHAEL PALIN:
They'll bomb the entire London area.

DIRECTION:
getting up

DIRECTION:
he grabs the photo of Eisenhower

MICHAEL PALIN:
They won't bomb

DIRECTION:
here

MICHAEL PALIN:
.

ERIC IDLE:
Are you sure?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Sure.

DIRECTION:
sitting down with great relief

ERIC IDLE:
Right. When are they going to start?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well apparently they haven't got Neutron yet... but when they do...

DIRECTION:
The diners have by this time joined a conga led by the gypsy violinist playing 'My Mistake'. Awfully heartily they dance past the prime minister's desk. Cut to Artic wastes. The wind howls. The trapper is sitting beside a fire, picking his nose thoughtfully and tending a stewpan. The dog bounds back, Carpenter on the end of his lead, breathless from trying to keep up.

TERRY JONES:
Well. Did he tell you anything?

DIRECTION:
worn out by the walk

ERIC IDLE:
No ... we chased sticks ... we chased a few reindeer...

DIRECTION:
patting the dog

TERRY JONES:
You been chasing reindeer, have you? You're a naughty boy... yes... ain't you a naughty boy...

ERIC IDLE:
Look, we haven't got much time ... He hasn't given me any information yet...

TERRY JONES:
OK. Tell you what, let's eat. You give him one of your meatballs, he'll tell you anything... OK?

ERIC IDLE:
OK.

DIRECTION:
Suddenly the dog woofs, gets up on back legs and starts pawing the trapper.

TERRY JONES:
Wait a minute - he's trying to tell us something.

DIRECTION:
A strangled, strained American voice comes from within the dog. Slightly muffled perhaps.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Carpenter ... er ... ugh ... ah...Carpenter...

DIRECTION:
kneeling down and peering into the dog's face

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, Mr Salad? Can you hear me?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes... yes... it's just it's so goddam painful in here... what's the problem?

ERIC IDLE:
It's Mr Neutron, sir ... he's gone missing. The Supreme Commander wants you to take charge.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I ... oh God ... I ... I ... I...

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, Mr Salad?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I gotta go walkies again.

DIRECTION:
Cut to the office of the supreme commander. He is now nude behind his desk. A kidney bowl full of water is on desk; he is dabbing at himself with a sponge. The intercom buzzes. He switches it on.

DIRECTION:
Still no sign of Captain Carpenter, sir... or Mr Neutron.

MICHAEL PALIN:
OK. We'll bomb Neutron out. Get me Moscow! Peking! and Shanklin, Isle of Wight!

DIRECTION:
Cut to stock film of B52s on a bombing raid.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And so the Great Powers and the people of Shanklin, Isle of Wight, drew their net in ever-tightening circles around the most dangerous threat to peace the world has ever faced. They bombed Cairo, Bangkok, Cape Town, Buenos Aires, Harrow, Hammersmith, Stepney, Wandsworth and Enfield... But always it was the wrong place.

DIRECTION:
Cut to an area of smoking rubble. A van with the words 'US Air Force' on the side trundles through the rubble. It has a loudspeaker on the top of it.

ERIC IDLE:
Sorry Enfield!... We apologize for any inconvenience caused by our bombing... sorry...

MICHAEL PALIN:
But what of Mr Neutron, the most fearfully dangerous man in the world! The man who could destroy entire galaxies with his wrist, the man who could tear fruit machines apart with his eyeballs... He had not been idle!

DIRECTION:
Meantime we have mixed through to Neutron's suburban sitting room. He is standing in the doorway gazing at something off camera. He holds an envelope which he has just opened and a letter.

MICHAEL PALIN:
In fact he had fallen in love... with the lady who 'does' for Mrs Entrail...

DIRECTION:
The camera pans across to a slovenly char in paisley apron, furry slippers and head scarf. Throughout this scene we hear the sound of bombers and the distant muffled sound of explosions.

TERRY JONES:
Oh 'ello Mr N, terrible about Enfield, innit? It's all gone. So's Staines ... lovely shops they used to have in Staines... and Stunmore, where the AA offices used to be. I don't know where we'll pay our AA subscriptions to now. Do you know where we'll have to pay our AA. subscriptions to now, Mr N?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I didn't know you were a member of the AA Mrs S.C.U.M.

TERRY JONES:
Oh yes. Ever since the Corsair broke down in Leyonstone ... they towed it all the way to Deauville FOC.

DIRECTION:
Mr Neutron looks blank

TERRY JONES:
Free of Charge. Well my husband Ken, K.E.N., he said...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, forget about your husband, Mrs S.C.U.M. - or may I call you Mrs S?

TERRY JONES:
You can call me Linda, if you like.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, I'd rather call you Mrs S.

TERRY JONES:
Oh...

DIRECTION:
as if trying to soften the blow

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
And you can call me Mr N.

TERRY JONES:
Well... that's what I was calling you.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Mrs S, there is something I have to tell you...

TERRY JONES:
Yes, Mr N?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I have just won a Kellogg's Corn Flake Competition.

TERRY JONES:
Oh Mr N! That's wonderful!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I got the ball in exactly the right place. The prize is £5,000 in cash, or as much ice cream as you can eat.

DIRECTION:
Her eyes go round as saucers and all thoughts of returning to her marital bed vanish under the impact of such imminent wealth.

TERRY JONES:
£5,000!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I was thinking of taking the ice cream.

DIRECTION:
alarmed

TERRY JONES:
Oh no!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It's been so hot recently.

TERRY JONES:
You couldn't eat that much ice cream Mr N.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Mrs S, I can eat enormous quantifies of ice cream without being sick.

TERRY JONES:
Oh no! Take the £5,000! Please take the £5,000.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I was thinking. If we got married...

TERRY JONES:
Oh yes!

DIRECTION:
she sits very close to him

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
We could use the £5,000 to buy a spoon...

TERRY JONES:
Oh! We could buy a lot more than that!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
And then fill up with ice cream.

TERRY JONES:
No! Forget about the ice cream. We need the money.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
We need nothing. For there is something I have not told you Mrs S.C.U.M.

TERRY JONES:
Oh please call me Mrs S.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No I would rather go back to calling you Mrs S.C.U.M., Mrs S.C.U.M. I am the most powerful man in the universe. There is nothing I cannot do.

TERRY JONES:
Oh Mr N.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I want you to be my helpmate. As Tarzan had his Jane, as Napoleon had his Josephine, as Frankie Laine had whoever he had, I want you to help me in my plan to dominate the world!

TERRY JONES:
Oh Mr N. That I should be so lucky!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You're not Jewish are you?

DIRECTION:
Cut back to the Yukon. The trapper, Captain Carpenter and the dog are still sitting round the dying campfire over the remains of supper. They are all looking a little bit bored. The dog has obviously been telling long reminiscences.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Another time when I was in Cairo, I was disguised as a water hydrant. The whole top part of my head had been removed and...

ERIC IDLE:
Please, Mr Salad .... you must tell us where Neutron is.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And I functioned! D'you hear? I really worked. I could put out a fire.

ERIC IDLE:
Please, Mr Salad...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Mind you, it hurt a bit...

ERIC IDLE:
Please, Mr Salad - there isn't much time. Where will we find Neutron?

MICHAEL PALIN:
OK. Give me another meatball and I'll tell you.

DIRECTION:
Carpenter grabs a meatball and throws it down for the dog. The dog wolfs it. Carpenter and Trapper exchange glances. Carpenter bends nearer the dog. The dog finishes the meatball with much slurping. Carpenter crouches beside him patiently.

MICHAEL PALIN:
OK listen carefully... I won't repeat this. You understand?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes yes - quick.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I know where Neutron is right now. I know the exact address and the exact house and the exact road...

ERIC IDLE:
OK where is he?

MICHAEL PALIN:
He's not in America...

ERIC IDLE:
No?

MICHAEL PALIN:
He's not in... Asia!

MICHAEL PALIN:
He's not in.., Australia!

MICHAEL PALIN:
He's in... Europe!

ERIC IDLE:
Yeah?

MICHAEL PALIN:
And you wanna know where in Europe?

ERIC IDLE:
Yeah!

MICHAEL PALIN:
OK. OK, I'll tell you. He's in England... In London... at Number 19...

DIRECTION:
A sudden explosion completely engulfs them. Cut to the supreme commander's offce. He is still nude and has an enormous display of talcs and powders on his desk. He is talking to the intercom.

MICHAEL PALIN:
OK. That's the Yukon - what's left?

DIRECTION:
Only Ruislip, the Gobi Desert, and your office, sir.

MICHAEL PALIN:
OK! Let's start with my office.

DIRECTION:
a big explosion

DIRECTION:
Cut to the Gobi Desert. Sweltering heat. We come onto a group opening a GPO box. There is a line of boxes stretching into the distance as far as the eye can see. Arabic is being spoken by the GPO official.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ankwat i odr inkerat Gobi Desert Ulverston Road...

DIRECTION:
SUBTITLE: 'THIS NEW BOX COMPLETES THE ENCIRCLEMENT OF THE GOBI DESERT'

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ik artwar, hyaddin...

DIRECTION:
etc.

DIRECTION:
SUBTITLE: 'THE POST OFFICE IS NOW IN A POSITION TO ACHIEVE COMPLETE WORLD DOMINATION'

DIRECTION:
A terrific explosion. Cut to Neutron and Mrs Scum.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I will take you away from all this Mrs S.C.U.M.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, Mr N... I'd follow you anywhere.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
We will have two weeks in Benidorm.

TERRY JONES:
Oh yes ... yes.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
And I will make you the most beautiful woman in the world.

DIRECTION:
He stretches out his hands towards her. His piercing eyes narrow in concentration. There is a flash, a jump cut, and Mrs S stands before him as dumpy and unattractive as ever, but in a brand new C & A twin set and pearls, a nice new handbag, and a rather fussy hat.

TERRY JONES:
Oh... it's beautiful... oh, Mr N, you have made my heart sing...

DIRECTION:
quick cut to stock film of bomber then back to Mrs Scum

DIRECTION:
quick flash of bomber then back to Mrs Scum

TERRY JONES:
Life's rich harvest is being...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Shut up, Mrs S. We must hurry...

DIRECTION:
He takes her hand and pulls her away.

TERRY JONES:
I'd better leave a note for Ken... he'll be expecting us...

DIRECTION:
explosion

ANIMATION:

DIRECTION:
the world destroyed and burning.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Has Mr Neutron escaped in time? Is the world utterly destroyed? How can Mr Neutron and his child bride survive? Will his mighty powers be of any avail against the holocaust? Stay tuned to this channel.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a man in a grey suit in a studio.

ERIC IDLE:
Hello. Well in fact what happens is that they are saved by Mr Neutron's mighty powers just as the last bomb falls on Ruislip.

DIRECTION:
SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'A MAN FROM THE "RADIO TIMES"'

ERIC IDLE:
However, the Earth has been blown off its axis, and in a most dramatic and dangerous and expensive sequence, it spins off into space. There are appallingly expensive scenes of devastation and horror and the final incredibly expensive climax is reached as thousands of ape monsters in very expensive costumes descend from the sky onto these, plug up a whole city which has to be specially built and fling them all into the sea very expensively. And we can see those very expensive scenes right now.

DIRECTION:
the credits start on his TV set

ERIC IDLE:
Just after the credits have gone through... incidentally, these are going to be the most expensive and lavish scenes ever filmed by the BBC in conjunction with Time-Life of course ... these are some of the technical people who have been involved in filming these very expensive scenes, expensive sound, expensive visual effects there, expensive production assistant, expensive designer... cheap director. Well you can see those expensive scenes right now.
