ERIC IDLE:
Oh, hello. My name's Carpenter. I'm from the US Government.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Are you from the army?

ERIC IDLE:
Er... no... I'm... er... I'm... I'm from the ballet. The US Government Ballet.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
The ballet! The ballet's coming here?

ERIC IDLE:
Well maybe...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, that's great! We love the ballet. Last year some of us from Yellow River got a party to go see the ballet in Montreal.

ERIC IDLE:
Look, I was wondering...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, we had a

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
time. It was Margot Fonteyn dancing 'Les Sylphides'... oh, it was so beautiful...

ERIC IDLE:
Do you know...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Do you know how old she is?

ERIC IDLE:
Who?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Margot Fonteyn.

ERIC IDLE:
No.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
She's 206!

ERIC IDLE:
Look, I hear there's a US

ERIC IDLE:
organizer round these parts by the name of Teddy Salad.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You mean the special agent?

ERIC IDLE:
Well...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
He's an ex-CIA man. He's not a ballet dancer.

ERIC IDLE:
Well, I just want to see him on some ballet business...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, you could try the store...

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, thank you.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Hey! Can you get us Lionel Blair's autograph?

MICHAEL PALIN:
While precious time was being lost in Canada, the seconds were ticking away for the free world...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Already Neutron - who, you will remember, is infinitely the most dangerous man in the world, he

MICHAEL PALIN:
is - was gathering allies together.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Try having an omelette for your evening meal... perhaps with yogurt and grapefruit.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, I've tried that ... I once got down to fifty-six stone. But I couldn't stay like that. I used to take potatoes wherever I went. I used to go to the cinema with three hundredweight of King Edwards, I'd eat 'em all before I got out of the toilet. I had to go on to bread.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What about salad?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Teddy Salad?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no, no - salad - as in lettuces, radishes, cucumber...

MICHAEL PALIN:
You don't like it?

ERIC IDLE:
No, I didn't want to

ERIC IDLE:
a salad. I wanted to find out about a man called Salad.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You're the first person to order a salad for two years. All the Eskimos eat here is fish, fish ...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Eskimos.

TERRY JONES:
Where's our fish. We've finished our fish.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What fish you want today, uh?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Bream please.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Bream! Where do I get a bream this time of year? You bloody choosy Eskimo pests.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
We are

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Eskimos!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Why don't you like a nice plate of canelloni?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
That's not fish.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I've had my lot of the Arctic Circle. I wish I was back in Oldham ...

ERIC IDLE:
Do any of you Eskimos ... speak ... English?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
We're not Eskimos!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Haddock!

ERIC IDLE:
Do any of... you ... know... a man ... called ... Salad?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What, Salad as in...

ERIC IDLE:
Lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes ... yes.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Like you have on your plate?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes. That's right.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, I'm afraid not.

TERRY JONES:
Where's our fish?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What does this Teddy Salad do?

ERIC IDLE:
He's a... er... hen-teaser.

ERIC IDLE:
Che cosa è la stucciacatori di polli?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, the only Teddy Salad we know is a CIA man.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, he might know.

ERIC IDLE:
Where will I find him?

TERRY JONES:
Oh, he lives up at Kipper Sound.

ERIC IDLE:
Thanks a lot.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Are you in international spying, too?

ERIC IDLE:
No... no... I'm with the... US Ballet... force... who are you with?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
MI6. But not a word to the Eskimos.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Here's your bloody fish.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Thank you, Anouk.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'm not an Eskimo!

ERIC IDLE:
Hey! Hey!

ERIC IDLE:
Hi! I'm Carpenter of the US Ballet.

TERRY JONES:
Hey, great to have you around. The last decent ballet we got around here was Ballet Ramben..On Thursday they did 'Petrouchka', then on Saturday they did 'Fille Mal Gardée'. I thought it was a bit slow...

ERIC IDLE:
It sure is nice to see you, Mr Salad.

TERRY JONES:
I ain't Salad.

ERIC IDLE:
What?

TERRY JONES:
You want Teddy Salad?

ERIC IDLE:
Yeah ...

ERIC IDLE:
I don't see anyone.

TERRY JONES:
The one on the end, on the right. That's Salad.

ERIC IDLE:
That's a dog!

TERRY JONES:
of it.

ERIC IDLE:
What do you mean?

TERRY JONES:
Listen, Teddy Salad is the most brilliant agent the CIA ever had, right?

ERIC IDLE:
Right.

TERRY JONES:
That's how he made his name

TERRY JONES:
- disguise!

ERIC IDLE:
That's incredible!

TERRY JONES:
He had to slim down to one and a half pounds to get into that costume. He cut eighteen inches off each arm and over three feet off each leg. The most brilliant surgeon in Europe stuck that tail on.

ERIC IDLE:
What about the head?

TERRY JONES:
All of the head was removed apart from the eyes and the brain in order to fit into the costume.

TERRY JONES:
D'you want to talk to him?

ERIC IDLE:
Yeah, sure.

TERRY JONES:
OK, let's move over to those trees over there... anyone might be watching.

TERRY JONES:
Mr Salad? ... There's Mr Carpenter to see you.

ERIC IDLE:
What does he say?

TERRY JONES:
All right, you've got his trust, now, you can talk to him.

ERIC IDLE:
The General says you're the only one who'll know where to find him ... What's he say?

TERRY JONES:
He wants to go walkies.

ERIC IDLE:
Walkies?

TERRY JONES:
Yeah, he's right into it today - d'you mind taking him for walkies?

MICHAEL PALIN:
While Carpenter took the most brilliant agent the CIA ever had for walkies, events in the world's capitals were moving fast!

ERIC IDLE:
Very well, show him in.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Prime Minister.

ERIC IDLE:
Do take a seat.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Prime Minister, we've just had the Supreme Commander US Forces on the phone. Apparently they want a full-scale Red Alert!

ERIC IDLE:
They what?

MICHAEL PALIN:
They want a full-scale Red Alert - every troop movement...

ERIC IDLE:
It's all right - don't worry about Giuseppe...

ERIC IDLE:
He's English really.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well apparently the whole structure of world peace may be threatened unless we immediately...

TERRY JONES:
Your anniversary, signore?

ERIC IDLE:
No, no, Giuseppe - not now.

TERRY JONES:
You mean zis isn't ze lady?

ERIC IDLE:
No.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, signora ... my mistake! I play for you 'My Mistake'.

TERRY JONES:
'Oh my mistake...'

ERIC IDLE:
Giuseppe, do you mind playing over there.

TERRY JONES:
Very well, signor. But I play only for you... and your beautiful companion.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well anyway, this Mr Neutron, is located somewhere in the London area. We must find and exterminate him. The Americans say if we don't, they will.

ERIC IDLE:
What?

MICHAEL PALIN:
The Americans say if we won't

MICHAEL PALIN:
will!

ERIC IDLE:
That he doesn't know

ERIC IDLE:
?

MICHAEL PALIN:
They'll bomb the entire London area.

MICHAEL PALIN:
They won't bomb

MICHAEL PALIN:
.

ERIC IDLE:
Are you sure?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Sure.

ERIC IDLE:
Right. When are they going to start?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well apparently they haven't got Neutron yet... but when they do...

TERRY JONES:
Well. Did he tell you anything?

ERIC IDLE:
No ... we chased sticks ... we chased a few reindeer...

TERRY JONES:
You been chasing reindeer, have you? You're a naughty boy... yes... ain't you a naughty boy...

ERIC IDLE:
Look, we haven't got much time ... He hasn't given me any information yet...

TERRY JONES:
OK. Tell you what, let's eat. You give him one of your meatballs, he'll tell you anything... OK?

ERIC IDLE:
OK.

TERRY JONES:
Wait a minute - he's trying to tell us something.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Carpenter ... er ... ugh ... ah...Carpenter...

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, Mr Salad? Can you hear me?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes... yes... it's just it's so goddam painful in here... what's the problem?

ERIC IDLE:
It's Mr Neutron, sir ... he's gone missing. The Supreme Commander wants you to take charge.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I ... oh God ... I ... I ... I...

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, Mr Salad?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I gotta go walkies again.

MICHAEL PALIN:
OK. We'll bomb Neutron out. Get me Moscow! Peking! and Shanklin, Isle of Wight!

MICHAEL PALIN:
And so the Great Powers and the people of Shanklin, Isle of Wight, drew their net in ever-tightening circles around the most dangerous threat to peace the world has ever faced. They bombed Cairo, Bangkok, Cape Town, Buenos Aires, Harrow, Hammersmith, Stepney, Wandsworth and Enfield... But always it was the wrong place.

ERIC IDLE:
Sorry Enfield!... We apologize for any inconvenience caused by our bombing... sorry...

MICHAEL PALIN:
But what of Mr Neutron, the most fearfully dangerous man in the world! The man who could destroy entire galaxies with his wrist, the man who could tear fruit machines apart with his eyeballs... He had not been idle!

MICHAEL PALIN:
In fact he had fallen in love... with the lady who 'does' for Mrs Entrail...

TERRY JONES:
Oh 'ello Mr N, terrible about Enfield, innit? It's all gone. So's Staines ... lovely shops they used to have in Staines... and Stunmore, where the AA offices used to be. I don't know where we'll pay our AA subscriptions to now. Do you know where we'll have to pay our AA. subscriptions to now, Mr N?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I didn't know you were a member of the AA Mrs S.C.U.M.

TERRY JONES:
Oh yes. Ever since the Corsair broke down in Leyonstone ... they towed it all the way to Deauville FOC.

TERRY JONES:
Free of Charge. Well my husband Ken, K.E.N., he said...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, forget about your husband, Mrs S.C.U.M. - or may I call you Mrs S?

TERRY JONES:
You can call me Linda, if you like.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, I'd rather call you Mrs S.

TERRY JONES:
Oh...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
And you can call me Mr N.

TERRY JONES:
Well... that's what I was calling you.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Mrs S, there is something I have to tell you...

TERRY JONES:
Yes, Mr N?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I have just won a Kellogg's Corn Flake Competition.

TERRY JONES:
Oh Mr N! That's wonderful!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I got the ball in exactly the right place. The prize is £5,000 in cash, or as much ice cream as you can eat.

TERRY JONES:
£5,000!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I was thinking of taking the ice cream.

TERRY JONES:
Oh no!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It's been so hot recently.

TERRY JONES:
You couldn't eat that much ice cream Mr N.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Mrs S, I can eat enormous quantifies of ice cream without being sick.

TERRY JONES:
Oh no! Take the £5,000! Please take the £5,000.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I was thinking. If we got married...

TERRY JONES:
Oh yes!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
We could use the £5,000 to buy a spoon...

TERRY JONES:
Oh! We could buy a lot more than that!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
And then fill up with ice cream.

TERRY JONES:
No! Forget about the ice cream. We need the money.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
We need nothing. For there is something I have not told you Mrs S.C.U.M.

TERRY JONES:
Oh please call me Mrs S.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No I would rather go back to calling you Mrs S.C.U.M., Mrs S.C.U.M. I am the most powerful man in the universe. There is nothing I cannot do.

TERRY JONES:
Oh Mr N.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I want you to be my helpmate. As Tarzan had his Jane, as Napoleon had his Josephine, as Frankie Laine had whoever he had, I want you to help me in my plan to dominate the world!

TERRY JONES:
Oh Mr N. That I should be so lucky!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You're not Jewish are you?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Another time when I was in Cairo, I was disguised as a water hydrant. The whole top part of my head had been removed and...

ERIC IDLE:
Please, Mr Salad .... you must tell us where Neutron is.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And I functioned! D'you hear? I really worked. I could put out a fire.

ERIC IDLE:
Please, Mr Salad...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Mind you, it hurt a bit...

ERIC IDLE:
Please, Mr Salad - there isn't much time. Where will we find Neutron?

MICHAEL PALIN:
OK. Give me another meatball and I'll tell you.

MICHAEL PALIN:
OK listen carefully... I won't repeat this. You understand?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes yes - quick.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I know where Neutron is right now. I know the exact address and the exact house and the exact road...

ERIC IDLE:
OK where is he?

MICHAEL PALIN:
He's not in America...

ERIC IDLE:
No?

MICHAEL PALIN:
He's not in... Asia!

MICHAEL PALIN:
He's not in.., Australia!

MICHAEL PALIN:
He's in... Europe!

ERIC IDLE:
Yeah?

MICHAEL PALIN:
And you wanna know where in Europe?

ERIC IDLE:
Yeah!

MICHAEL PALIN:
OK. OK, I'll tell you. He's in England... In London... at Number 19...

MICHAEL PALIN:
OK. That's the Yukon - what's left?

MICHAEL PALIN:
OK! Let's start with my office.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ankwat i odr inkerat Gobi Desert Ulverston Road...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ik artwar, hyaddin...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I will take you away from all this Mrs S.C.U.M.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, Mr N... I'd follow you anywhere.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
We will have two weeks in Benidorm.

TERRY JONES:
Oh yes ... yes.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
And I will make you the most beautiful woman in the world.

TERRY JONES:
Oh... it's beautiful... oh, Mr N, you have made my heart sing...

TERRY JONES:
Life's rich harvest is being...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Shut up, Mrs S. We must hurry...

TERRY JONES:
I'd better leave a note for Ken... he'll be expecting us...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Has Mr Neutron escaped in time? Is the world utterly destroyed? How can Mr Neutron and his child bride survive? Will his mighty powers be of any avail against the holocaust? Stay tuned to this channel.

ERIC IDLE:
Hello. Well in fact what happens is that they are saved by Mr Neutron's mighty powers just as the last bomb falls on Ruislip.

ERIC IDLE:
However, the Earth has been blown off its axis, and in a most dramatic and dangerous and expensive sequence, it spins off into space. There are appallingly expensive scenes of devastation and horror and the final incredibly expensive climax is reached as thousands of ape monsters in very expensive costumes descend from the sky onto these, plug up a whole city which has to be specially built and fling them all into the sea very expensively. And we can see those very expensive scenes right now.

ERIC IDLE:
Just after the credits have gone through... incidentally, these are going to be the most expensive and lavish scenes ever filmed by the BBC in conjunction with Time-Life of course ... these are some of the technical people who have been involved in filming these very expensive scenes, expensive sound, expensive visual effects there, expensive production assistant, expensive designer... cheap director. Well you can see those expensive scenes right now.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh come on you can give us another minute, Mr Cotton, please.
