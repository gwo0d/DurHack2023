GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Goodday, Bruce!

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, Hello Bruce!

MICHAEL PALIN:
How are yer Bruce?

ERIC IDLE:
Bit crook, Bruce.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Where's Bruce?

ERIC IDLE:
He's not here, Bruce.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Blimey, s'hot in here, Bruce.

ERIC IDLE:
S'hot enough to boil a monkey's bum!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
That's a strange expression, Bruce.

ERIC IDLE:
Well Bruce, I heard the Prime Minister use it. S'hot enough to boil a monkey's bum in 'ere, your Majesty,' he said and she smiled quietly to herself.

MICHAEL PALIN:
She's a good Sheila, Bruce and not at all stuck up.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ah, here comes the Bossfella now! - how are you, Bruce?

JOHN CLEESE:
Goodday, Bruce, Hello Bruce, how are you, Bruce? Gentlemen, I'd like to introduce a chap from pommie land... who'll be joining us this year here in the Philosophy Department of the University of Woolamaloo.

JOHN CLEESE:
Michael Baldwin - this is Bruce. Michael Baldwin - this is Bruce. Michael Baldwin - this is Bruce.

ERIC IDLE:
Is your name not Bruce, then?

TERRY JONES:
No, it's Michael.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
That's going to cause a little confusion.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Mind if we call you 'Bruce' to keep it clear?

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, Gentlemen, I think we'd better start the meeting. Before we start, though, I'll ask the padre for a prayer.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh Lord, we beseech thee, have mercy on our faculty, Amen!!

JOHN CLEESE:
Crack the tubes, right!

JOHN CLEESE:
Er, Bruce, I now call upon you to welcome Mr. Baldwin to the Philosophy Department.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'd like to welcome the pommy bastard to God's own earth, and I'd like to remind him that we don't like stuck-up sticky-beaks here.

JOHN CLEESE:
Now, Bruce teaches classical philosophy, Bruce teaches Haegelian philosophy, and Bruce here teaches logical positivism, and is also in charge of the sheepdip.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What's does new Bruce teach?

JOHN CLEESE:
New Bruce will be teaching political science - Machiavelli, Bentham, Locke, Hobbes, Sutcliffe, Bradman, Lindwall, Miller, Hassett, and Benet.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Those are cricketers, Bruce!

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, spit!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Howls of derisive laughter, Bruce!

JOHN CLEESE:
In addition, as he's going to be teaching politics, I've told him he's welcome to teach any of the great socialist thinkers, provided he makes it clear that they were

JOHN CLEESE:
.

JOHN CLEESE:
Any questions?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
New Bruce - are you a pooftah?

JOHN CLEESE:
Are you a pooftah?

TERRY JONES:
No!

JOHN CLEESE:
No right, well gentlemen, I'll just remind you of the faculty rules: Rule one - no pooftahs. Rule two, no member of the faculty is to maltreat the Abbos in any way whatsoever - if there's anybody watching. Rule three - no pooftahs. Rule four - I don't want to catch anyone not drinking in their room after lights out. Rule five - no pooftahs. Rule six - there is

JOHN CLEESE:
rule six! Rule seven - no pooftahs. That concludes the reading of the rules, Bruce.

ERIC IDLE:
This here's the wattle - the emblem of our land. You can stick it in a bottle or you can hold it in your hand.

JOHN CLEESE:
Gentlemen, at six o'clock I want every man-Bruce of you in the Sydney Harbour Bridge room to take a glass of sherry with the flying philosopher, Bruce, and I call upon you, padre, to close the meeting with a prayer.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh Lord, we beseech thee etc. etc. etc., Amen.

ERIC IDLE:
Right, let's get some Sheilas.

JOHN CLEESE:
OK.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ah, elevenses.

MICHAEL PALIN:
This should tide us over 'til lunchtime.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Reckon so, Bruce.

ERIC IDLE:
Sydney Nolan! What's that!
