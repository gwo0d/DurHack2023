JOHN CLEESE:
Right, sergeant major - there's no time to lose.

TERRY JONES:
Beg pardon, sir?

JOHN CLEESE:
No time to lose.

TERRY JONES:
No what, sir?

JOHN CLEESE:
No time ... no time to lose.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, I see, sir.

TERRY JONES:
No time ... to ... lose!!

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, that's right, yes.

TERRY JONES:
Yes, no time to lose, sir!

JOHN CLEESE:
Right.

TERRY JONES:
Isn't that funny, sir... I've never come across that phrase before - 'no time to lose'. Forty-two years I've been in the regular army and I've never heard that phrase.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, it's in perfectly common parlance.

TERRY JONES:
In what, sir?

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh never mind... right ... no time to lose.

TERRY JONES:
Eventually, yes, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
What?

TERRY JONES:
Like you say, sir. We'll be able to make time, eventually without to lose, sir, no.

JOHN CLEESE:
Look, I don't think you've quite got the hang of this phrase, sergeant major.

ERIC IDLE:
Morning, no time to lose ...

ERIC IDLE:
Now then, how were you thinking of using the phrase?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, I was thinking of using it ... er .. like .., well ... 'good morning dear, what is in no time to lose?'

ERIC IDLE:
Er yes ... well ... you've not quite got the hang of that, have you.

ERIC IDLE:
Now, you want to use this phrase in everyday conversation, is that right?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, that's right.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes ... good ...

MICHAEL PALIN:
You see my wife and I have never had a great deal to say to each other ...

MICHAEL PALIN:
In the old days we used to find things to say, like 'pass the sugar'... or, 'that's my flannel', but in the last ten or fifteen years there just hasn't seemed to be anything to say, and anyway I saw your phrase advertised in the paper and I thought, that's the kind of thing I'd like to say to her...

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, well, what we normally suggest for a beginner such as yourself, is that you put your alarm clock back ten minutes in the morning, so you can wake up, look at the clock and use the phrase immediately.

ERIC IDLE:
Shall we try it?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes.

ERIC IDLE:
All right - I'll be the alarm clock. When I go off, look at me and use the phrase, OK?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No!

MICHAEL PALIN:
to lose!

ERIC IDLE:
No... No time to lose.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No time to

MICHAEL PALIN:
?

ERIC IDLE:
No time to lose.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No

MICHAEL PALIN:
to lose.

ERIC IDLE:
No - to

ERIC IDLE:
... like Toulouse in France. No time Toulouse.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No time

MICHAEL PALIN:
lose...

ERIC IDLE:
No time Toulouse.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No time Toulouse...

ERIC IDLE:
No! - no time to

ERIC IDLE:
!

MICHAEL PALIN:
No - no time to

MICHAEL PALIN:
!

JOHN CLEESE:
Anyway, no time to lose, sergeant major.

TERRY JONES:
Look out, sir! MacDonald!

TERRY JONES:
We'll have to hurry, sir.

TERRY JONES:
He's reached the sixth plane already, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
Right, here are the plans sergeant major, good luck.

TERRY JONES:
Thank you, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
And good luck to you, MacDonald.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Thank you, sir.

TERRY JONES:
Right you are, MacDonald. No time to lose.

JOHN CLEESE:
Very good, sergeant major.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, excellent...

MICHAEL PALIN:
So it was that on a cold November morning, RSM Urdoch and Sapper MacDonald, one of the most highly trained Kamikaze experts the Scottish Highlands have ever witnessed, left on a mission which was to... oh I can't go on with this drivel.

TERRY JONES:
All right, MacDonald, no time to lose.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Aaaaaaugh!

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, that's the mission - now here's the method. RSM Murdoch will lull the enemy into a false sense of security by giving them large quantities of money, a good home, and a steady job. Then, when they're upstairs with the wife, Sapper MacDonald will hurl himself at the secret documents, destroying them and himself. Well, that's the plan, the time is now 19.42 hours. I want you to get to bed, have a good night's rest and be up on parade early in the morning. Thank you for listening and thank you for a lovely supper.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And...and...sue...so...the...the...intripid...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Intrepid RSM Urdoch and super...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Sapper MacDonald...mead...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Made their why...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Way toarra...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Towards the Rusty...Ritzy...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Russian bolder...

MICHAEL PALIN:
...and so RSM Urdoch and Sapper MacDonald made their way towards the Russian bolder...
