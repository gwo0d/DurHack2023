JOHN CLEESE:
Right, sergeant major - there's no time to lose.

DIRECTION:
The sergeant is sitting on MacDonald. He strikes him on head.

TERRY JONES:
Beg pardon, sir?

JOHN CLEESE:
No time to lose.

TERRY JONES:
No what, sir?

JOHN CLEESE:
No time ... no time to lose.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, I see, sir.

DIRECTION:
making gestures

TERRY JONES:
No time ... to ... lose!!

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, that's right, yes.

TERRY JONES:
Yes, no time to lose, sir!

JOHN CLEESE:
Right.

TERRY JONES:
Isn't that funny, sir... I've never come across that phrase before - 'no time to lose'. Forty-two years I've been in the regular army and I've never heard that phrase.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, it's in perfectly common parlance.

TERRY JONES:
In what, sir?

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh never mind... right ... no time to lose.

TERRY JONES:
Eventually, yes, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
What?

TERRY JONES:
Like you say, sir. We'll be able to make time, eventually without to lose, sir, no.

JOHN CLEESE:
Look, I don't think you've quite got the hang of this phrase, sergeant major.

DIRECTION:
The same frontage of smart London salon as before. Only this time the big sign reads 'No Time To Lose Advice Centre'. The same bowler-hatted man goes in. The same interior, same desk. A consultant sits behind it, and motions for the man to sit down.

ERIC IDLE:
Morning, no time to lose ...

DIRECTION:
he picks up a card which reads 'no time to lose'; he keeps flashing it every so often

ERIC IDLE:
Now then, how were you thinking of using the phrase?

DIRECTION:
He pulls down a blind behind him on the right which also reads 'no time to lose' in large letters. He lets it go and it rolls up again fast.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, I was thinking of using it ... er .. like .., well ... 'good morning dear, what is in no time to lose?'

ERIC IDLE:
Er yes ... well ... you've not quite got the hang of that, have you.

DIRECTION:
He gets out a two-foot-square cube with 'no time to lose' in the same lettering as it always is, and puts it on the desk. He points to this in a manic way with a forefinger. He has the words 'no time to lose' on the back of his hand.

DIRECTION:
sings

DIRECTION:
to stop the manic fit he reaches inside desk, pours a drink from a bottle on which is written 'no time to lose'

ERIC IDLE:
Now, you want to use this phrase in everyday conversation, is that right?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, that's right.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes ... good ...

DIRECTION:
He stands up, makes a strange noise, and flings the back of his jacket up over his head revealing 'no time to lose' written on the inside of the back lining of his jacket, upside down so that it is the right way up when it is revealed.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You see my wife and I have never had a great deal to say to each other ...

DIRECTION:
tragic, heart-rending music creeps in under the dialogue

MICHAEL PALIN:
In the old days we used to find things to say, like 'pass the sugar'... or, 'that's my flannel', but in the last ten or fifteen years there just hasn't seemed to be anything to say, and anyway I saw your phrase advertised in the paper and I thought, that's the kind of thing I'd like to say to her...

DIRECTION:
The consultant pushes down a handle and a large screen comes up in front of him. On it is written 'no time to lose'. He burts through the paper.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, well, what we normally suggest for a beginner such as yourself, is that you put your alarm clock back ten minutes in the morning, so you can wake up, look at the clock and use the phrase immediately.

DIRECTION:
he holds up the card briefly

ERIC IDLE:
Shall we try it?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes.

ERIC IDLE:
All right - I'll be the alarm clock. When I go off, look at me and use the phrase, OK?

DIRECTION:
ticks then imitates ringing

MICHAEL PALIN:
No!

DIRECTION:
Time

MICHAEL PALIN:
to lose!

ERIC IDLE:
No... No time to lose.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No time to

DIRECTION:
lose

MICHAEL PALIN:
?

ERIC IDLE:
No time to lose.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No

DIRECTION:
time

MICHAEL PALIN:
to lose.

ERIC IDLE:
No - to

DIRECTION:
lose

ERIC IDLE:
... like Toulouse in France. No time Toulouse.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No time

DIRECTION:
too

MICHAEL PALIN:
lose...

ERIC IDLE:
No time Toulouse.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No time Toulouse...

ERIC IDLE:
No! - no time to

ERIC IDLE:
!

MICHAEL PALIN:
No - no time to

MICHAEL PALIN:
!

ANIMATION:

DIRECTION:
Toulouse-Lautrec in a wild-west gunfight.

DIRECTION:
No-time Toulouse. The story of the wild and lawless days of the post-Impressionists.

DIRECTION:
Cut back to the guardroom at Edinburgh Castle. MacDonald is edging towards the window.

JOHN CLEESE:
Anyway, no time to lose, sergeant major.

TERRY JONES:
Look out, sir! MacDonald!

DIRECTION:
They both rush to window and grab MacDonald's legs as he disappears through it.

TERRY JONES:
We'll have to hurry, sir.

DIRECTION:
they haul him back into the room to reveal he is carrying a saw with which he starts trying to saw off his head

DIRECTION:
he snatches the saw and throws it away

TERRY JONES:
He's reached the sixth plane already, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
Right, here are the plans sergeant major, good luck.

TERRY JONES:
Thank you, sir.

DIRECTION:
he salutes

DIRECTION:
MacDonald is by now trying to strangle himself with his bare hands.

JOHN CLEESE:
And good luck to you, MacDonald.

DIRECTION:
MacDonald breaks off from strangling himself, to offer a snappy salute.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Thank you, sir.

DIRECTION:
He immediately snaps back into trying to strangle himself.

TERRY JONES:
Right you are, MacDonald. No time to lose.

JOHN CLEESE:
Very good, sergeant major.

DIRECTION:
Quick cut to the consultant in the office.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, excellent...

DIRECTION:
Cut back to the gates of Edinburgh Castle. Dawn. Music. As the voice starts the gates open and a lorry emerges.

MICHAEL PALIN:
So it was that on a cold November morning, RSM Urdoch and Sapper MacDonald, one of the most highly trained Kamikaze experts the Scottish Highlands have ever witnessed, left on a mission which was to... oh I can't go on with this drivel.

DIRECTION:
By this time we have cut to a close up of the cab to show RSM Urdoch at the wheel, with MacDonald beside him. MacDonald has a revolver and is apparently having an unsuccessful game of Russian roulette.

TERRY JONES:
All right, MacDonald, no time to lose.

DIRECTION:
Suddenly MacDonald hurls himself out of the lorry.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Aaaaaaugh!

DIRECTION:
The RSM slams the brakes on. Skidding noises. Cut to shot of the lorry skidding to a halt. The RSM leaps out, picks up MacDonald who is lying on the floor hitting himself, and loads him into the back of the lorry. He gets back into the lorry and they start off again. They haven't gone more than a few yards before we see MacDonald leap out of the back of the lorry, race round to the front and throw himself down in front of the lorry. The lorry runs right over him. He picks himself up after it has gone, races up to the front and tries it again... and again... and again... and again... and again...

DIRECTION:
Cut to the captain, standing in front of a huge map. He points with a stick.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, that's the mission - now here's the method. RSM Murdoch will lull the enemy into a false sense of security by giving them large quantities of money, a good home, and a steady job. Then, when they're upstairs with the wife, Sapper MacDonald will hurl himself at the secret documents, destroying them and himself. Well, that's the plan, the time is now 19.42 hours. I want you to get to bed, have a good night's rest and be up on parade early in the morning. Thank you for listening and thank you for a lovely supper.

DIRECTION:
Pull out to reveal that he is in a very small sitting room, alone apart from his wife who sits knitting by the fire not listening to a word he's saying.

DIRECTION:
Cut to the 'Book at Bedtime' set. Seven or eight technicians, a make-up girl. etc. still crowding around Toogood as he tries to read.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And...and...sue...so...the...the...intripid...

DIRECTION:
Intrepid.

DIRECTION:
Intrepid.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Intrepid RSM Urdoch and super...

DIRECTION:
Sapper.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Sapper MacDonald...mead...

DIRECTION:
Made!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Made their why...

DIRECTION:
Way!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Way toarra...

DIRECTION:
Towards...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Towards the Rusty...Ritzy...

DIRECTION:
Russian!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Russian bolder...

DIRECTION:
Border!

DIRECTION:
Map with an animated line showing the route.

MICHAEL PALIN:
...and so RSM Urdoch and Sapper MacDonald made their way towards the Russian bolder...

DIRECTION:
Border!!...Border.

DIRECTION:
the line becomes part of an animated skit on the famous film '2001'.
