JOHN CLEESE:
Come in.

JOHN CLEESE:
Ah, Frog.

ERIC IDLE:
S. Frog, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
Shut up, I want to have a word with you, Frog.

JOHN CLEESE:
Shut up. It's about your advertising campaign for Conquistador Coffee. Now, I've had the managing director of Conquistador to see me this morning and he's very unhappy with your campaign. Very unhappy. In fact, he's shot himself.

ERIC IDLE:
Badly, sir?

JOHN CLEESE:
No, extremely well.

JOHN CLEESE:
, the effect of which was how disappointed he was with your work and, in particular, why you had changed the name from Conquistador Instant Coffee to Conquistador Instant Leprosy. Why, Frog?

JOHN CLEESE:
Shut up. Why did you do it?

ERIC IDLE:
It was a joke.

JOHN CLEESE:
A joke?

ERIC IDLE:
No, no not a joke, a sales campaign.

JOHN CLEESE:
I see, Frog.

JOHN CLEESE:
Shut up. Now, let's have a look at the sales chart.

JOHN CLEESE:
When you took over this account, Frog, Conquistador was a brand leader. Here you introduced your first campaign, 'Conquistador Coffee brings a new meaning to the word vomit'. Here you made your special introductory offer of a free dead dog with every jar, and this followed your second campaign 'the tingling fresh coffee which brings you exciting new cholera, mange, dropsy, the clap, hard pad and athlete's head. From the House of Conquistador'.

ERIC IDLE:
It was a soft-sell, sir

JOHN CLEESE:
Why, Frog?

JOHN CLEESE:
Shut up! Well?

ERIC IDLE:
Well, people know the name, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
They certainly do know the name - they burnt the factory down. The owner is hiding in my bathroom

ERIC IDLE:
You're not going to fire me, sir?

JOHN CLEESE:
Fire you? Three men dead, the factory burnt down, the account lost and our firm completely bankrupt, what... what... what ... can you possibly say? What excuse can you possibly make?

ERIC IDLE:
Sorry, father.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, yes. Oh, incidentally your film's won a prize.
