JOHN CLEESE:
Number nineteen. The nose.

JOHN CLEESE:
Come in.

JOHN CLEESE:
Ah! Mr Luxury Yacht. Do sit down, please.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ah, no, no. My name is

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
'Luxury Yacht' but it's pronounced 'Throatwobbler Mangrove'.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, do sit down then Mr Throatwobbler Mangrove.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Thank you.

JOHN CLEESE:
Now, what seems to be the trouble?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Um, I'd like you to perform some plastic surgery on me.

JOHN CLEESE:
I see. And which particular feature of your anatomy is causing you distress?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, well for a long time now, in fact, even when I was a child ... I ... you know, whenever I left home to ... catch a bus, or... to catch a train... and even my tennis has suffered actually...

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes. To be absolutely blunt you're worried about your enormous hooter.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No!

JOHN CLEESE:
No?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, and you want me to hack a bit off.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Please.

JOHN CLEESE:
Fine. It is a startler, isn't it? Er, do you mind if I... er.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What?

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, no nothing, then, well, I'll just examine your nose.

JOHN CLEESE:
Mr Luxury Yacht, this nose of yours is false. It's made of polystyrene and your own hooter's a beaut. No pruning necessary.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'd still like the operation.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, you've had the operation, you strange person.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Please do an operation.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, all right, all right, but only ... if you come on a camping holiday with me.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
He asked me! He asked me!
