JOHN CLEESE:
Number nineteen. The nose.

DIRECTION:
A man sitting behind a desk in a Harley Street consulting room. Close-up of the name plate on desk in front of him. Although the camera does not reveal this for a moment, this name plate, about two inches high, continues all along the desk, off the side of it at the same height and halfway round the room. We start to track along this name plate on which is written: 'Professor Sir Adrian Furrows F.R.S. F.R.C.S. F.R.C.P. M.D.M.S. (Oxon), Mall Ph.D., M. Se. (Cantab), Ph.D. (Syd), ER.G.S., F.R.C.O.G., F. FM.R.C.S., M.S. (Birm), M.S. (Liv), M.S. (Guadalahara), M.S. (Karach), M.S. (Edin), B.A. (Chic), B. Litt. (Phil), D. Litt (Phil), D. Litt (Arthur and Lucy), D. Litt (Ottawa), D. Litt (All other places in Canada except Medicine Hat, B. Sc. 9 Brussels, Liege, Antwerp, Asse, (and Grower) '. There is a knock on the door.)

JOHN CLEESE:
Come in.

DIRECTION:
The door opens and Raymond Luxury Yacht enters. He cannot walk straight to the desk as his passage is barred by the strip of wood carrying the degrees, but he discovers the special hinged part of it that opens like a door. Mr Luxury Yacht has his enormous polystyrene nose. It is a foot long.

JOHN CLEESE:
Ah! Mr Luxury Yacht. Do sit down, please.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ah, no, no. My name is

DIRECTION:
spelt

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
'Luxury Yacht' but it's pronounced 'Throatwobbler Mangrove'.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, do sit down then Mr Throatwobbler Mangrove.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Thank you.

JOHN CLEESE:
Now, what seems to be the trouble?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Um, I'd like you to perform some plastic surgery on me.

JOHN CLEESE:
I see. And which particular feature of your anatomy is causing you distress?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, well for a long time now, in fact, even when I was a child ... I ... you know, whenever I left home to ... catch a bus, or... to catch a train... and even my tennis has suffered actually...

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes. To be absolutely blunt you're worried about your enormous hooter.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No!

JOHN CLEESE:
No?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, and you want me to hack a bit off.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Please.

JOHN CLEESE:
Fine. It is a startler, isn't it? Er, do you mind if I... er.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What?

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, no nothing, then, well, I'll just examine your nose.

DIRECTION:
he does so; as he examines it the nose comes off in his hand

JOHN CLEESE:
Mr Luxury Yacht, this nose of yours is false. It's made of polystyrene and your own hooter's a beaut. No pruning necessary.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'd still like the operation.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, you've had the operation, you strange person.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Please do an operation.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, all right, all right, but only ... if you come on a camping holiday with me.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
He asked me! He asked me!
