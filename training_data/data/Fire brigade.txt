DIRECTION:
Animated sketch leads to little old Mrs Little on the phone in her hall. She is a dear little old lady and lives in a rather fussy ducks-on-wall house.

TERRY JONES:
Hello, is that the fire brigade?

DIRECTION:
Cut to the fire station.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, sorry, wrong number.

DIRECTION:
He puts the phone back. Pull out to reveal four or five firemen in full gear, surrounded by fire-fighting equipment and a gleaming fire engine. The firemen are engaged in a variety of homely pursuits: one is soldering a crystal set, another is cooking at a workbench, another is doing embroidery, another is at a sewing machine. The first fireman is at the phone on the wall. He goes back to clearing up a budgie's cage.

ERIC IDLE:
That phone's not stopped ringing all day.

DIRECTION:
What happens when you've mixed the batter, do you dice the ham with the coriander?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, no, you put them in separately when the vine leaves are ready.

DIRECTION:
The phone rings.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, no, not again.

DIRECTION:
Take it off the hook.

DIRECTION:
The first fireman takes the phone off the hook. Cut back to Mrs Little on phone. She looks at the receiver then listens again.

TERRY JONES:
I can't get the fire brigade Mervyn.

DIRECTION:
Mervyn, her 38-year-old, 6' 8" son appears.

JOHN CLEESE:
Here, let me try, dear. You go and play the cello.

TERRY JONES:
Oh it doesn't do any good, dear.

JOHN CLEESE:
Look. Do you want the little hamster to live or not?

TERRY JONES:
Yes I do, Mervyn.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well go and play the cello!

DIRECTION:
She looks helplessly at him, then goes into the sitting room. Mervyn dials.

JOHN CLEESE:
Hello, hello, operator? Yes we're trying to get the fire brigade ... No, the fire brigade. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, what? ...

DIRECTION:
he takes one of his shoes off and looks in it

JOHN CLEESE:
Size eight. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, no of course not, Yes...

DIRECTION:
Mrs Little appears, dabbing at her eyes with a handkerchief.

DIRECTION:
touching Mervyn gently on the arm

TERRY JONES:
He's gone, dear.

JOHN CLEESE:
What?

TERRY JONES:
He's slipped away.

TERRY JONES:
The sodding hamster's dead!

DIRECTION:
broken

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh no!! What were you playing?

TERRY JONES:
Some Mozart concertos, dear.

JOHN CLEESE:
What... How did he... ?

TERRY JONES:
His eyes just closed, and he fell into the wastepaper basket. I've covered him with a copy of the 'Charlie George Football Book'.

DIRECTION:
handing her the phone

JOHN CLEESE:
Right, you hang on. I must go and see him.

TERRY JONES:
There was nothing we could do, Mervyn. If we'd have had the whole Philharmonic Orchestra in there, he'd still have gone.

JOHN CLEESE:
I'm going upstairs, I can't bear it.

DIRECTION:
restraining him

TERRY JONES:
There isn't an upstairs dear, it's a bungalow.

JOHN CLEESE:
Damn.

DIRECTION:
he storms off

DIRECTION:
into the phone

DIRECTION:
she takes her shoe off and looks inside

TERRY JONES:
size three, yes it's just - we've lost a dear one and my son was ... yes, that's right, size eight, yes and... Oh I see... yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, I see, yes, yes, I, I ... Yes, yes. No ... no... yes, I see. They can't get the fire brigade Mervyn - will the Boys' Brigade do?

DIRECTION:
off

JOHN CLEESE:
No! They'd be useless!

TERRY JONES:
No, he doesn't want anyone at the moment, thank you. No, yes, yes, no thank you for trying, yes, yes, ... no, Saxones, yes, yes thank you, bye, bye.
