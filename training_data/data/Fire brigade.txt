TERRY JONES:
Hello, is that the fire brigade?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, sorry, wrong number.

ERIC IDLE:
That phone's not stopped ringing all day.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, no, you put them in separately when the vine leaves are ready.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, no, not again.

TERRY JONES:
I can't get the fire brigade Mervyn.

JOHN CLEESE:
Here, let me try, dear. You go and play the cello.

TERRY JONES:
Oh it doesn't do any good, dear.

JOHN CLEESE:
Look. Do you want the little hamster to live or not?

TERRY JONES:
Yes I do, Mervyn.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well go and play the cello!

JOHN CLEESE:
Hello, hello, operator? Yes we're trying to get the fire brigade ... No, the fire brigade. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, what? ...

JOHN CLEESE:
Size eight. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, no of course not, Yes...

TERRY JONES:
He's gone, dear.

JOHN CLEESE:
What?

TERRY JONES:
He's slipped away.

TERRY JONES:
The sodding hamster's dead!

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh no!! What were you playing?

TERRY JONES:
Some Mozart concertos, dear.

JOHN CLEESE:
What... How did he... ?

TERRY JONES:
His eyes just closed, and he fell into the wastepaper basket. I've covered him with a copy of the 'Charlie George Football Book'.

JOHN CLEESE:
Right, you hang on. I must go and see him.

TERRY JONES:
There was nothing we could do, Mervyn. If we'd have had the whole Philharmonic Orchestra in there, he'd still have gone.

JOHN CLEESE:
I'm going upstairs, I can't bear it.

TERRY JONES:
There isn't an upstairs dear, it's a bungalow.

JOHN CLEESE:
Damn.

TERRY JONES:
size three, yes it's just - we've lost a dear one and my son was ... yes, that's right, size eight, yes and... Oh I see... yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, I see, yes, yes, I, I ... Yes, yes. No ... no... yes, I see. They can't get the fire brigade Mervyn - will the Boys' Brigade do?

JOHN CLEESE:
No! They'd be useless!

TERRY JONES:
No, he doesn't want anyone at the moment, thank you. No, yes, yes, no thank you for trying, yes, yes, ... no, Saxones, yes, yes thank you, bye, bye.
