GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Five shillings a dozen? That's ordinary cabbages, is it? And what about the bombs?... Good Lord, they

DIRECTION:
are

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
expensive.

DIRECTION:
A corporal rushes in.

ERIC IDLE:
Sir!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, what is it?

ERIC IDLE:
News from the Western Front, sir.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes ... ?

ERIC IDLE:
Big enemy attack at dawn, sir ...

ERIC IDLE:
Well, the enemy were all wearing little silver halos, sir ... and ... they had fairy wands with big stars on the end ... and ...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
They what ... ?

ERIC IDLE:
.. and ... they had spiders in matchboxes, sir.

DIRECTION:
in disbelief

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Good God! How did our chaps react?

ERIC IDLE:
Well, they were jolly interested, sir. Some of them ... I think it was the 4th Armoured Brigade, sir, they ... well, they went and had a look at the spiders, sir.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh my God! All right, thank you, Shirley.

DIRECTION:
A girl emerges from under the table. She is a blonde WAAF.

DIRECTION:
to a sergeant

DIRECTION:
the sergeant opens the door, Churchill stands outside

DIRECTION:
the sergeant shuts the door

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Gentlemen, it's now quite apparent that the enemy are not only fighting this war on the cheap, but they're also not taking it seriously.

TERRY GILLIAM:
Bastards ...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
First they drop cabbages instead of decent bombs ...

ERIC IDLE:
The crates were probably quite expensive, sir.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Quiet, critic! And now they're doing very silly things in one of the most vital areas of the war!

TERRY GILLIAM:
What are we going to do, Shirley?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, we've got to act fast before it saps morale. We're going to show these Chinese ...

DIRECTION:
Germans, sir.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
These Germans ... we're going to show them that no British soldier will descend to their level. Anyone found trivialising this war will face the supreme penalty that military law can provide.

DIRECTION:
he holds a heroic pose; there is a pause during which we expect to cut; we don't; suddenly he breaks out of the pose into informality

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
That was all right, I think?

DIRECTION:
getting out drinks

DIRECTION:
Seemed to go quite well.
