JOHN CLEESE:
Excuse me, I would like to buy a fish license, please.

DIRECTION:
the man behind the counter points to next grille; to camera

DIRECTION:
he goes to next grille

JOHN CLEESE:
Hello, I would like to buy a fish licence, please.

MICHAEL PALIN:
A what?

JOHN CLEESE:
A license for my pet fish, Eric.

MICHAEL PALIN:
How did you know my name was Eric?

JOHN CLEESE:
No no no, my

DIRECTION:
fish's

JOHN CLEESE:
name is Eric, Eric the fish. 'E's an 'alibut.

JOHN CLEESE:
He is an halibut.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You've got a pet halibut?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes. I chose him out of thousands. I didn't like the others, they were all too flat.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You must be a loony.

JOHN CLEESE:
I am not a looney! Why should I be tied with the epithet looney merely because I have a pet halibut? I've heard tell that Sir Gerald Nabardo has a pet prawn called Simon and you wouldn't call him a looney; furthermore, Dawn Pailthorpe, the lady show-jumper, had a clam, called Stafford, after the late Chancellor, Allan Bullock has two pikes, both called Chris, and Marcel Proust had an haddock! So, if you're calling the author of 'A la recherche du temps perdu' a looney, I shall have to ask you to step outside!

MICHAEL PALIN:
All right, all right, all right. You want a licence.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes.

MICHAEL PALIN:
For a fish.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You

DIRECTION:
are

MICHAEL PALIN:
a loony.

JOHN CLEESE:
Look, it's a bleeding pet, isn't it? I've got a license for me pet dog Eric, and I've got a license for me pet cat Eric...

MICHAEL PALIN:
You don't need a license for a cat.

JOHN CLEESE:
I bleeding well do and I got one. Ho, ho, you're not catching me out there.

MICHAEL PALIN:
There's no such thing as a bloody cat license.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes there is!

MICHAEL PALIN:
No there isn't!

JOHN CLEESE:
Is!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Isn't!

JOHN CLEESE:
What's that then?

MICHAEL PALIN:
This is a dog license with the word 'dog' crossed out and the word 'cat' written in in crayon.

JOHN CLEESE:
The man didn't have the proper form.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What man?

JOHN CLEESE:
The man from the cat detector van.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Loony detector van, you mean.

JOHN CLEESE:
It's people like you what cause unrest.

MICHAEL PALIN:
All right, what cat detector van?

JOHN CLEESE:
The cat detector van from the Ministry of Housinge.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Housinge?

JOHN CLEESE:
It was spelt like that on the van. I'm very observant!. I never seen so many bleeding aerials. The man said that their equipment could pinpoint a purr at four hundred yards...and Eric, being such a happy cat, was a piece of cake.

MICHAEL PALIN:
How much did you pay for this?

JOHN CLEESE:
Sixty quid, and eight guineas for the fruit bat.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What fruit bat?

JOHN CLEESE:
Eric the fruit-bat.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Are all your pets called Eric?

JOHN CLEESE:
There's nothing so odd about that: Kemal Ataturk had an entire menagerie, all called Abdul!

MICHAEL PALIN:
No he didn't!

DIRECTION:
takes book from pocket

JOHN CLEESE:
He did, he did, he did, he did and did. There you are. 'Kemal Ataturk, the Man' by E. W. Swanton with a foreword by Paul Anka, page 91, please.

DIRECTION:
referring to page 91

MICHAEL PALIN:
I owe you an apology, sir.

JOHN CLEESE:
Spoken like a gentleman, sir. Now, are you going to give me a fish license?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I promise you that there is no such thing. You don't need one.

JOHN CLEESE:
Then I would like a statement to that effect signed by the Lord Mayor.

DIRECTION:
Fanfare of trumpets. Mayor gorgeously dressed with dignitaries enters flanked by trumpeters.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You're in luck.

DIRECTION:
In long shot now. The Mayor, who is nine foot high, and dignitaries approach a startled Praline. Organ music below a reverent voice over:

JOHN CLEESE:
And now, there is the Mayor. Surely the third tallest mayor in Derby's history. And there are the Aldermen magnificently resplendent in their Aldermanic hose and just look at the power in those thighs. The New Zealanders are going to find it pretty tough going in the set pieces in the second half... So Dawn Palethorpe with one clear round on Sir Gerald... and now the Mayor has reached the Great Customer Mr Eric Praline.

DIRECTION:
the mayor takes a piece of Paper from the post office man

DIRECTION:
the mayor signs it and hands it to Praline

DIRECTION:
Praline looks very confused

JOHN CLEESE:
has finally gone spare and there is the going sparal look on the front of his head. And now the Aldermen are finishing their oranges and leaving the post office for the start of the second half.
