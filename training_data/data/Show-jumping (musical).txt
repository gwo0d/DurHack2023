Cut to the scene on a TV screen and pull out from the TV to Mrs Mock Tudor and Mrs Elizabeth III in their sitting room watching it.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What I want to know Mrs Elizabeth III, is why they give us crap like that, when there's bits of the Leicester by-pass what have never been shown. Biskwit?

DIRECTION:
takes biskwit from plate

TERRY JONES:
Oh, thank yew ...

DIRECTION:
Mrs Mock Tudor switches her TV switch. The Arab boy winces in great pain and moves over to the set. He changes channels. Up comes a picture of the motorway again. Roller caption superimposed over the motorway. Appropriate 'Crossroads' type theme music.

DIRECTION:
Mrs Elizabeth III throws the switch and the Arab boy winces with real pain and turns the knob of the television set which changes channels. On the TV set we see the same two ladies watching their set as before with the tramps on it. They continue watching until the two ladies on the set speak.

DIRECTION:

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Bloody repeats.

ERIC IDLE:
Hello and welcome to Show-Jumping from White City ...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, moto-cross!

ERIC IDLE:
... and it's Anneli Drummond-Hay on Mr Softee just about to go into jump-off against the clock. The short pause is for the stewards who are repairing the Sound of Music.

DIRECTION:

DIRECTION:
the group start singing 'The Hills are Alive'; the bell goes for the start of the round and the lady rider sets of towards the group

And there's the bell. She's got 1.07 seconds to beat, but she needs a clear round to win. As she comes towards the Sound of Music and ...

DIRECTION:
Cut away to the two ladies watching their TV. Shot from an angle so we can't see the screen.

TERRY JONES:
Quite exciting.

DIRECTION:
Cut back to White City to see the lady rider has just cleared the obstacle. A cheer from the crowd. The music changes to 'Oklahoma'. Follow her round to see a similar group dressed as for 'Oklahoma'. Ten hayseeds and six wenches with a hay wagon. Most have primitive pitch forks and are sucking on straws.

ERIC IDLE:
... beautifully taken, and now she needs to pick up speed for Oklahoma, but not too much. This is where Alan Jones knocked down poor Judd, but ... And ... she's taken it superbly!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You notice how we never actually see the horses jump.

Cheer from TV. Cut back to White City. The horse is coming away from Oklahoma. Cut to run up to Black and White Minstrels.

Wait for it ...

DIRECTION:
Cut back to White City.

ERIC IDLE:
And! She's taken it ...

DIRECTION:
cheer; we actually see the lady jumper jump over the chorus of mistrels

ERIC IDLE:
She's over the Minstrels. She just flicked Leslie Crowther with her tail, but the time's good, and now she turns before coming into the final jump ... this is a tough one ... It's Ben-Hur - forty-six chariots ... 6,000 spectators ... 400 slaves, lion-handlers, the Emperor Nero and the entire Coliseum. 198 feet high. 400 years across!
