GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
His Royal Majesty, Louis XIV of France.

DIRECTION:
Mr Bartlett's head pops in and whispers loudly to butler.

DIRECTION:
And Mr Bartlett.

DIRECTION:
The butler pushes him aside. Fanfare. Enter Louis XIV and two tough-looking advisers. He is resplendent in state robes.

ERIC IDLE:
Your Majesty. It's a great privilege. Welcome to our humble abode.

DIRECTION:
in very broad Glaswegian accent

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's er... very nice to be here.

DIRECTION:
calling

ERIC IDLE:
O'Toole.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Sir?

ERIC IDLE:
Claret for His Majesty please.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
There's a Mr Barttett outside again, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
Not now, I can't see him, we have the King of France here.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, sir.

DIRECTION:
He exits. Jacques and the king stand in rather embarrassed silence. Jacques eventually speaks.

ERIC IDLE:
Your Majesty. You had a pleasant journey, I trust?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes... yes, oh definitely... yes... yes. Oh aye, aye.

DIRECTION:
Silence.

ERIC IDLE:
You have come from Paris?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Where?

ERIC IDLE:
From Paris... you have travelled from Paris?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh yes, we've come from Paris... yes... yes, yes, we've just come from... er... Paris... yes.

DIRECTION:
The butler comes back in.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, O'Toole?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Which one is the claret, sir?

ERIC IDLE:
The claret is in the decanter.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
The wooden thing?

ERIC IDLE:
No no... the glass thing... the glass decanter with the round glass stopper.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh yes, behind the door.

ERIC IDLE:
No no... on the sideboard.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
The sideboard?

ERIC IDLE:
The sideboard... yes. Look... you go into the salle Ã  manger ... the

DIRECTION:
dining room

ERIC IDLE:
, right? - and the sideboard is on your left, by the wall, beside the master's portrait.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ah! Above the mirror, sir?

ERIC IDLE:
No! No! The mirror is on the other side. It's

DIRECTION:
opposite

ERIC IDLE:
the mirror.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
But that's the

DIRECTION:
table

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
No... you don't go as

DIRECTION:
far

ERIC IDLE:
as the table. You go into the room, right?... on your right is the door to the orangery, straight ahead of you is the door to the library, and to your left is the sideboard.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ah, yes, I see, sir...

ERIC IDLE:
And the claret is on top of the sideboard, to the left.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
On the left.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
As one looks at it, sir?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I see, sir, thank you.

DIRECTION:
he turns to go

ERIC IDLE:
Will you please tell Monsieur Joseph our guest is here.

DIRECTION:
He leaves. There is another embarrassed silence.

ERIC IDLE:
I'm sorry about that, Your Majesty.

DIRECTION:
re-entering

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Apparently, sir, there is a plan to build a canal between the two Egyptian towns of..,

ERIC IDLE:
Not now, O'Toole!

DIRECTION:
The butler exits. More silence.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well... er... Mr Montgolfier... let's not beat around the bush ... my... dukes and I are very busy men. What we'd like to do is see the plans of your proposed balloon... if that's at all possible.

ERIC IDLE:
Certainly, Your Majesty... I have them here ready prepared.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, great .... then... what we would like to do ... is er... to take them back with us for the Royal Archives of er...

DIRECTION:
also Glaswegian

DIRECTION:
France.

MICHAEL PALIN:
France, aye.

ERIC IDLE:
Well, it is indeed a great honour Your Majesty, that I cannot refuse.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right! OK! Let's get 'em.

DIRECTION:
He and his two dukes are suddenly galvanized into action. They are about to grab the plans when Joseph enters, clad only in a towel and rather silly bath hat.

TERRY JONES:
Just a moment!

ERIC IDLE:
Joseph!

DIRECTION:
indicating the king

TERRY JONES:
This man is not Louis XIV!

ERIC IDLE:
Joseph! Are you out of your mind!

TERRY JONES:
I've been looking it up in my bath. Louis XIV died in 1717. It's now 1783! Answer me that!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Did I say Louis XIV? Oh, sorry, I meant Louis XV... Louis XV.

DIRECTION:
He

TERRY JONES:
died in 1774!

DIRECTION:
Louis, getting rather hot and angry, comes over to Joseph belligerently.

MICHAEL PALIN:
All right, Louis

DIRECTION:
XVI

MICHAEL PALIN:
!... listen to me, smartarse, when you're King of France,... you've got better things to do than go around all day remembering your bloody number.

DIRECTION:
Putting his face very close to Joseph's. He butts him sharply and viciously on the bridge of the nose with his forehead in the time-honoured Glaswegian way.

TERRY JONES:
Aaaaaarh!

DIRECTION:
He reels away, clutching his nose in agony. Louis approaches Jacques, equally belligerently.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right! You want to argue about numbers?

ERIC IDLE:
Er... no, no.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right, well... lets get hold of the plans for the Royal Archives. We've got to get back to... er...

DIRECTION:
Paris.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Paris by tonight so get a move on..

TERRY JONES:
Aaaargh! Ow! Ooooohh!

DIRECTION:
The butler reappears.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I got as far as the sideboard, sir...

DIRECTION:
Louis and his dukes grab the plans and push past the butler and across to an open window. There is a bit of a scuffle at the window as they are clambering out at the same time as two men in black with a projector and screen are clambering in.

TERRY JONES:
Stop them... oh! Ah... oooooohh!

DIRECTION:
to Jacques

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No news on the canal I'm afraid, sir, but apparently in India they're thinking of building a railway between the towns of Lahore...

TERRY JONES:
Stop... ow! Stop them, O'Toole for... oh! shit! God's sake... stop them, they've got the plans!

DIRECTION:
he rushes to the window

DIRECTION:
By now the men in black have set up the screen. On the screen comes film of Louis and his men racing through the gardens away from the Montgolfier' s home.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Will Louis XVI get away with the Montgolfiers' precious plans? Is sixteen years of work to be stolen by this suspect sovereign? Is France really in the grip of a Glaswegian monarch? Watch next week's episode of 'The Golden Age of Ballooning'... Now!

DIRECTION:
Cut to animation/titles as before. Music.

DIRECTION:
CAPTION: 'THE GOLDEN AGE OF BALLOONING'

DIRECTION:
CAPTION: 'EPISODE THREE: THE GREAT DAY FOR FRANCE'

DIRECTION:
Cut to a TV discussion in progress. An urgent, impressive current affairs show called 'Derision '. Two opulent-looking men and a presenter.

DIRECTION:
SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'SIR CHARLES DIVIDENDS'

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
... But now that the Government has collapsed ... and shown itself incapable of providing any sort of unifying force, I feel we do need the stability and the breathing space that a military presence would provide.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Lord Interest?

DIRECTION:
SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'LORD INTEREST'

ERIC IDLE:
Oh yes... I agree that the army should take over, but I think it should not interfere with the programme of street executions, which I feel have been the shot in the arm that the British economy so desperately needed.

DIRECTION:
As they drone on, the presenter turns away from them to talk softly into the camera.

MICHAEL PALIN:
The Montgolfier brothers' plans did indeed turn up... six months later, and a long way from Paris, at the court of King George III of England.
