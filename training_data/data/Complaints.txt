Cut back to milkman with doctor.

DIRECTION:
handing over yogurt

ERIC IDLE:
Mind you, that's just a pat diagnosis made without first obtaining your full medical history.

DIRECTION:
Cut to man at desk.

JOHN CLEESE:
I feel the time has come to complain about people who make rash complaints without first making sure that those complaints are justified.

DIRECTION:
Cut to Dr Cream.

TERRY JONES:
Are you referring to me?

DIRECTION:
Cut back to man.

JOHN CLEESE:
Not necessarily, however, I would like to point out that the BALPA spokesman was wearing the British Psychiatric Association Dinner Dance Club cuff-links.

TERRY JONES:
Oh yes, I noticed that too.

DIRECTION:
Cut to BALPA man.

ERIC IDLE:
These are not British Psychiatric Association Dinner Dance Club cuff-links.

DIRECTION:
Cut to man.

JOHN CLEESE:
Sorry.

ERIC IDLE:
They are in fact British Sugar Corporation Gilbert-and-Sullivan Society cuff-links. It is in fact a sort of in-joke with us lads here at BALPA. I think the last speaker should have checked his facts before making his own rash complaint.

TERRY JONES:
Yes, that'll teach him.

ERIC IDLE:
However, I would just like to add a complaint about shows that have too many complaints in them as they get very tedious for the average viewer.

DIRECTION:
Cut to another man.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'd like to complain about people who hold things up by complaining about people complaining. It's about time something was done about it.

Certainly, doctor. Walk this way, please.

Oh, if I could walk that way I...

ERIC IDLE:
Sssssh!

DIRECTION:
The milkmaid leads Mrs Pim into a building, and into a psychiatrist's office. Dr Cream is in a chair.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Mrs Pim to see you, Dr Cream.

TERRY JONES:
Ah yes. I just want another five minutes with Audrey. Could you show Mrs Pim into the waiting room, please.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Yes, doctor.

DIRECTION:
As milkmaid and Mrs Pim leave the room we see that there is a cow on the couch.

TERRY JONES:
Right, Audrey. When did you first start thinking you were a cow?

DIRECTION:
Milkmaid and Mrs Pim emerge from building through a herd of cows and we then have a montage of shots of them walking through countryside as in opening sequence of flying lesson sketch at beginning of show. They pass a tea trolley woman, the bishop learning his script...

MICHAEL PALIN:
