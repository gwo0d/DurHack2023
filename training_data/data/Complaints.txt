TERRY JONES:
I would like to take this opportunity of complaining about the way in which these shows are continually portraying psychiatrists who make pat diagnoses of patients' problems without first obtaining their full medical history.

ERIC IDLE:
Mind you, that's just a pat diagnosis made without first obtaining your full medical history.

JOHN CLEESE:
I feel the time has come to complain about people who make rash complaints without first making sure that those complaints are justified.

TERRY JONES:
Are you referring to me?

JOHN CLEESE:
Not necessarily, however, I would like to point out that the BALPA spokesman was wearing the British Psychiatric Association Dinner Dance Club cuff-links.

TERRY JONES:
Oh yes, I noticed that too.

ERIC IDLE:
These are not British Psychiatric Association Dinner Dance Club cuff-links.

JOHN CLEESE:
Sorry.

ERIC IDLE:
They are in fact British Sugar Corporation Gilbert-and-Sullivan Society cuff-links. It is in fact a sort of in-joke with us lads here at BALPA. I think the last speaker should have checked his facts before making his own rash complaint.

TERRY JONES:
Yes, that'll teach him.

ERIC IDLE:
However, I would just like to add a complaint about shows that have too many complaints in them as they get very tedious for the average viewer.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'd like to complain about people who hold things up by complaining about people complaining. It's about time something was done about it.

ERIC IDLE:
Nurse! Would you take Mrs Pim to see Dr Cream, please.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Certainly, doctor. Walk this way, please.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, if I could walk that way I...

ERIC IDLE:
Sssssh!

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Mrs Pim to see you, Dr Cream.

TERRY JONES:
Ah yes. I just want another five minutes with Audrey. Could you show Mrs Pim into the waiting room, please.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Yes, doctor.

TERRY JONES:
Right, Audrey. When did you first start thinking you were a cow?

MICHAEL PALIN:
'Jeez, Mr Belpit your legs is all swollen'...
