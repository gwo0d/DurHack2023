TERRY JONES:
Ah - good evening everyone, and welcome to the second of our Italian language classes, in which we'll be helping you brush up your Italian. Last week we started at the beginning, and we learnt the Italian for a 'spoon'. Now, I wonder how many of you can remember what it was?

TERRY JONES:
Not all at once ... sit down Mario. Giuseppe!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Il cucchiaio.

TERRY JONES:
Well done Giuseppe, or, as the Italians would say: 'Molto bene, Giuseppe'.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Grazie signor ... grazie di tutta la sua gentilezza.

TERRY JONES:
Well, now, this week we're going to learn some useful phrases to help us open a conversation with an Italian. Now first of all try telling him where you come from. For example, I would say: 'Sono Inglese di Gerrard's Cross', I am an Englishman from Gerrard's Cross. Shall we all try that together?

TERRY JONES:
Not too bad, now let's try it with somebody else. Er... Mr... ?

JOHN CLEESE:
Mariolini.

TERRY JONES:
Ah, Mr Mariolini, and where are you from?

JOHN CLEESE:
Napoli, signor.

TERRY JONES:
Ah ... you're an Italian.

JOHN CLEESE:
Si, si signor!

TERRY JONES:
Well in that case you would say: 'Sono Italiano di Napoli'.

JOHN CLEESE:
Ah, capisco, mile grazie signor...

ERIC IDLE:
Per favore, signor!

TERRY JONES:
Yes?

ERIC IDLE:
Non conosgeve parliamente, signor devo me parlo sono Italiano di Napoli quando il habitare de Milano.

TERRY JONES:
I'm sorry ... I don't understand!

MICHAEL PALIN:
My friend say 'Why must he say...'

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Bitte mein Herr. Was ist das Won für Mittelschmerz?

TERRY JONES:
Ah! Helmut - you want the German classes.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh ja! Danke schön.

MICHAEL PALIN:
My friend he say, 'Why must I say I am Italian from Napoli when he lives in Milan?'

TERRY JONES:
Ah, I... well, tell your friend ... if he lives in Milan he must say 'Sono Italiano di Milano...'

ERIC IDLE:
Eeeeeee! Milano è tanto meglio di Napoli. Milano è la citta la più bella di tutti ... nel mondo...

MICHAEL PALIN:
He say 'Milan is better than Napoli'.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, he shouldn't be saying that, we haven't done comparatives yet.
