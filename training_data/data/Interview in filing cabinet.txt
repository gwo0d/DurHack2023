MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah, well I'm afraid we have to stop the film there, as some of the scenes which followed were of a violent nature which might have proved distressing to some of our viewers. Though not to me, I can tell you.

MICHAEL PALIN:
first of all, congratulations on the victory.

TERRY JONES:
Thank you, David.

MICHAEL PALIN:
It should send you back to Botty with a big lead.

TERRY JONES:
Oh yes, well we're fairly confident, David.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well at the moment, Ludovic, you're crouching down inside a filing cabinet.

TERRY JONES:
Yes that's right, David, I'm trying not to be seen.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I see. Is this through fear?

TERRY JONES:
Oh no, no, it's common sense really. If they can't see you, they can't get you.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ha, ha, ha, but of course they can still hear you.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ludovic Grayson, thank you very much for coming on the program tonight. And we end the show with music. And here with their very latest recording 'Yummy, Yummy, Yummy, I've got love in my tummy' Jackie Charlton and the Tonettes.
