MICHAEL PALIN:
Hello. On 'Archaeology Today' tonight I have with me Professor Lucien Kastner of Oslo University.

TERRY JONES:
Good evening.

MICHAEL PALIN:
How tall are you, professor?

TERRY JONES:
... I beg your pardon?

MICHAEL PALIN:
How tall are you?

TERRY JONES:
I'm about five foot ten.

MICHAEL PALIN:
... and an expert in Egyptian tomb paintings. Sir Robert...

MICHAEL PALIN:
are you really five foot ten?

TERRY JONES:
Yes.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Funny, you look much shorter than that to me. Are you slumped forward in your chair at all?

TERRY JONES:
No, er I...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Extraordinary. Sir Robert Eversley, who's just returned from the excavations in El Ara, and you must be well over six foot. Isn't that right, Sir Robert?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes.

MICHAEL PALIN:
In fact, I think you're six foot five aren't you?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, that's marvelous. I mean you're a totally different kind of specimen to Professor Kastner. Straight in your seat, erect, firm.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes. I thought we were here to discuss archaeology.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, yes, of course we are, yes, absolutely, you're absolutely right! That's positive thinking for you.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Sir Robert Eversley, who's very interesting, what have you discovered in the excavations at El Ara?

JOHN CLEESE:
Well basically we have found a complex of tombs...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Very good speaking voice.

JOHN CLEESE:
... which present dramatic evidence of Polynesian influence in Egypt in the third dynasty which is quite remarkable.

MICHAEL PALIN:
How tall were the Polynesians?

TERRY JONES:
They were...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Sh!

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, they were rather small, seafaring...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Short men, were they... eh? All squat and bent up?

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, I really don't know about that...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Who were the tall people?

JOHN CLEESE:
I'm afraid I don't know.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Who's that very tall tribe in Africa?

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, this is hardly archaeology.

MICHAEL PALIN:
The Watutsi! That's it - the Watutsi! Oh, that's the tribe, some of them were eight foot tall. Can you imagine that. Eight foot of Watutsi. Not one on another's shoulders, oh no - eight foot of solid Watutsi. That's what I call tall.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, but it's nothing to do with archaeology.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh to hell with archaeology!

TERRY JONES:
Can I please speak! I came all the way from Oslo to do this program! I'm a professor of archaeology. I'm an expert in ancient civilizations. All right, I'm only five foot ten. All right my posture is bad, all right I slump in my chair. But I've had more women than either of you two! I've had half bloody Norway, that's what I've had! So you can keep your Robert Eversley! And you can keep your bloody Watutsi! I'd rather have my little body... my little five-foot-ten-inch body...

JOHN CLEESE:
Bloody fool. Look what you've done to him.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Don't bloody fool me.

JOHN CLEESE:
I'll do what I like, because I'm six foot five and I eat punks like you for breakfast.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'll get you for that, Eversley! I'll get you if I have to travel to the four corners of the earth!

CAROL CLEVELAND:
The dig was going well that year, We had discovered some Hittite baking dishes from the fifth dynasty, and Sir Robert was happier than I had ever seen him.

JOHN CLEESE:
Today I hear the robin sing

JOHN CLEESE:
Why, a Sumerian drinking vessel of the fourth dynasty.

JOHN CLEESE:
Catalogue this pot, Danielle, it's fourth dynasty.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh, is it... ?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, it's... Sumerian.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh, how wonderful! Oh, I am so happy for you.

JOHN CLEESE:
I'm happy too, now at last we know there was a Sumerian influence here in Abu Simnel in the early pre-dynastic period, two thousand years before the reign of Tutankhamun,

MICHAEL PALIN:
All right Eversley, get up out of that trench.

JOHN CLEESE:
Don't forget... I'm six foot five.

MICHAEL PALIN:
That doesn't worry me... Kastner.

TERRY JONES:
Here Lord.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Up!

JOHN CLEESE:
Eleven foot three!

TERRY JONES:
I'm so tall! I am so tall!

JOHN CLEESE:
Danielle!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Eleven foot six - damn you! Abdul

JOHN CLEESE:
Fifteen foot four! Mustapha!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Nineteen foot three... damn you!

MICHAEL PALIN:
And there we end this edition of 'Archaeology Today'. Next week, the Silbury Dig by Cole Porter with Pearl Bailey and Arthur Negus.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And now an appeal for sanity from the Reverend Arthur Belling.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You know, there are many people in the country today who, through no fault of their own, are sane. Some of them were born sane. Some of them became sane later in their lives. It is up to people like you and me who are out of our tiny little minds to try and help these people overcome their sanity. You can start in small ways with ping-pong ball eyes and a funny voice and then you can paint half of your body red and the other half green and then you can jump up and down in a bowl of treacle going 'squawk, squawk, squawk...' And then you can go 'Neurhhh! Neurhh!' and then you can roll around on the floor going 'pting pting pting' ...

MICHAEL PALIN:
The Reverend Arthur Belling is Vicar of St Loony Up The Cream Bun and Jam. And now an appeal on behalf of the National Trust.

ERIC IDLE:
Good evening. My name is Leapy Lee. No, sorry. That's the name of me favourite singer. My name is Mrs Fred Stone. No, no, Mrs Fred Stone is the wife of me favourite tennis player. My name is Bananas. No, no, that's me favourite fruit. I'm Mrs Nice- evening- out- at- the- pictures- then- perhaps- a- dance- at- a- club- and- back- to- his- place- for- a- quick- cup- of- coffee- and- little- bit- of - no! No, sorry, that's me favourite way of spending a night out. Perhaps I am Leapy Lee? Yes! I must be Leapy Lee! Hello fans! Leapy Lee here!

ERIC IDLE:
Good evening. I'm Mrs What-number-are-you-dialing-please?
