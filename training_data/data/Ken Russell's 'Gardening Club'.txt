ERIC IDLE:
And now back to the story.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
That was a nasty business back at the restaurant.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, I thought most places took Barclaycard nowadays.

ERIC IDLE:
Where do you think they're taking us, Brian?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
God knows!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Look!

ERIC IDLE:
The sacred volcano Andu! Which no man has seen before.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no, no, next to that.

JOHN CLEESE:
The London Brick Company?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no, no, no - next to that.

JOHN CLEESE:
The forbidden plateau of Roiurama, the Lost World, thrown up by mighty earth movements thousands of millions of years ago, where strange primeval creatures defying evolution, lurk in the dark, impenetrable forests, cut off forever from the outside world.

ERIC IDLE:
I still can't see it.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
You don't think that's where they're taking us?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, and God knows what we'll find there.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What page please?

ERIC IDLE:
What?

MICHAEL PALIN:
What page in the script?

ERIC IDLE:
Page 7.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Come on you dogs, we have time to lose, this has gone too far.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Meanwhile back in London ... at the British Explorers' Club in the Mall...

TERRY JONES:
Any news of Betty Bailey's expedition, Hargreaves?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Er ... um ... er...

TERRY JONES:
Page 9...

MICHAEL PALIN:
'The Lost World of Roiurama'.

TERRY JONES:
That's my line.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, sorry. 'Where were they going, sir'?

TERRY JONES:
The Lost World of Roiurama.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes sir, we've got a telegram.

TERRY JONES:
Oh

MICHAEL PALIN:
Reads it. Expedition superb. Weather excellent. Everything wonderful.

TERRY JONES:
I wonder what's gone wrong.

MICHAEL PALIN:
For God's sake be careful...

TERRY JONES:
Wait a minute... I'm going to go... after them.

MICHAEL PALIN:
For God's sake be careful, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
My God, Betty, we're done for...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
We'll never get out of here... we're completely lost, lost. Even the natives have gone.

JOHN CLEESE:
Goodbye Betty, Goodbye Farquarson. Goodbye Brian. It's been a great expedition...

JOHN CLEESE:
Great expedition ...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
All that'll be left of us will be a map, a compass and a few feet of film, recording our last moments...

JOHN CLEESE:
Wait a moment!

CAROL CLEVELAND:
What is it?

JOHN CLEESE:
If we're on film, there must be someone filming us.

ERIC IDLE:
My God, Betty, you're right!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Look! Great to see you!

JOHN CLEESE:
What a stroke of luck!

JOHN CLEESE:
Wait a minute!

CAROL CLEVELAND:
What is it again?

JOHN CLEESE:
If this is the crew who were filming us . .. who's filming us now? Look!

TERRY JONES:
Cut there man! No! No good! How we going to get feeling of personal alienation of self from society with this load of Bulldog Drummond crap? When I was doing 'La Notte' wi' dat Monica Vitti gal she don't gimme none of this empire building shit, man ...

ERIC IDLE:
Not so fast, Akarumba! Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Inspector Baboon of Scotland Yard's Special Fraud Film Director Squad, Jungle Division.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Baboon of the Yard!

ERIC IDLE:
Shut up!

ERIC IDLE:
... Signor Antonioni first makes use of colour to underline...
