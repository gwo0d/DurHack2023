1958

ERIC IDLE:
And now back to the story.

DIRECTION:
Cut to the edge of the jungle. Emerging from the dense undergrowth are two pygmy warriors pulling the four explorers who are roped together. The pygmies carry spears. We lose the pygmies and hold just the explorers in frame, and track with them.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
That was a nasty business back at the restaurant.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, I thought most places took Barclaycard nowadays.

ERIC IDLE:
Where do you think they're taking us, Brian?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
God knows!

DIRECTION:
pointing, eyes wide with amazement

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Look!

DIRECTION:
Cut to a stock shot of a volcano. Thrilling chord. Cut back to explorers.

DIRECTION:
filled with awe

ERIC IDLE:
The sacred volcano Andu! Which no man has seen before.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no, no, next to that.

DIRECTION:
Cut to stock shot of collection of big chimneys in a brickworks. Another thrilling chord. Cut back to explorers.

JOHN CLEESE:
The London Brick Company?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no, no, no - next to that.

DIRECTION:
Cut to stock shot of plateau of Roiurama. Yet another thrilling chord. Cut back to explorers.

JOHN CLEESE:
The forbidden plateau of Roiurama, the Lost World, thrown up by mighty earth movements thousands of millions of years ago, where strange primeval creatures defying evolution, lurk in the dark, impenetrable forests, cut off forever from the outside world.

ERIC IDLE:
I still can't see it.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
You don't think that's where they're taking us?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, and God knows what we'll find there.

DIRECTION:
A pigmy native rushes up from behind them, holding a script.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What page please?

ERIC IDLE:
What?

DIRECTION:
with a trace of irritation

MICHAEL PALIN:
What page in the script?

DIRECTION:
whispered

ERIC IDLE:
Page 7.

DIRECTION:
he speaks the lines over to himself

DIRECTION:
tries with eyes shut

DIRECTION:
throws away the script, starts to push them roughly

MICHAEL PALIN:
Come on you dogs, we have time to lose, this has gone too far.

DIRECTION:
Stock film of Houses of Parliament from across the Thames.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Meanwhile back in London ... at the British Explorers' Club in the Mall...

DIRECTION:
Cut to the leather-armchaired hallway of a London club. In four of the chairs sit men in polar explorers' kit - furs, iced-over goggles, etc. - reading newspapers. At one chair sits a man in Norfolk jacket and plus fours. Around his neck he wears a sign saying 'Our Hero'. He is reading a newspaper but obviously has something else on his mind. Suddenly he throws the paper down and gets up. He walks over to the porter's desk. As he does this a polar expedition with four huskies, a sled, and two explorers pass him. Our Hero goes up to the desk. A whiskery old porter stands behind it.

TERRY JONES:
Any news of Betty Bailey's expedition, Hargreaves?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Er ... um ... er...

DIRECTION:
through clenched teeth

TERRY JONES:
Page 9...

DIRECTION:
thumbing over page of script beneath counter

MICHAEL PALIN:
'The Lost World of Roiurama'.

TERRY JONES:
That's my line.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, sorry. 'Where were they going, sir'?

TERRY JONES:
The Lost World of Roiurama.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes sir, we've got a telegram.

TERRY JONES:
Oh

DIRECTION:
reads it

MICHAEL PALIN:
Reads it. Expedition superb. Weather excellent. Everything wonderful.

TERRY JONES:
I wonder what's gone wrong.

MICHAEL PALIN:
For God's sake be careful...

DIRECTION:
irritably

TERRY JONES:
Wait a minute... I'm going to go... after them.

MICHAEL PALIN:
For God's sake be careful, sir.

DIRECTION:
Cut to film of the lost world. Tropical South American vegetation. Our four explorers from Jungle Restaurant and Ken Russell's Gardening Club sketches limp along exhaustedly.

ERIC IDLE:
My God, Betty, we're done for...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
We'll never get out of here... we're completely lost, lost. Even the natives have gone.

JOHN CLEESE:
Goodbye Betty, Goodbye Farquarson. Goodbye Brian. It's been a great expedition...

DIRECTION:
Music. Cut to engraving of Crystal Palace.

DIRECTION:
SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'CRYSTAL PALACE 1851'

DIRECTION:
Cut immediately back to jungle.

JOHN CLEESE:
Great expedition ...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
All that'll be left of us will be a map, a compass and a few feet of film, recording our last moments...

JOHN CLEESE:
Wait a moment!

CAROL CLEVELAND:
What is it?

JOHN CLEESE:
If we're on film, there must be someone filming us.

ERIC IDLE:
My God, Betty, you're right!

DIRECTION:
They all look around, then gradually all notice the camera. They break out in smiles of relief, come towards the camera and greet the camera crew.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Look! Great to see you!

JOHN CLEESE:
What a stroke of luck!

DIRECTION:
Hello! ...

JOHN CLEESE:
Wait a minute!

CAROL CLEVELAND:
What is it again?

JOHN CLEESE:
If this is the crew who were filming us . .. who's filming us now? Look!

DIRECTION:
Cut to another shot which indudes the first camera crew and yet another camera crew with all their equipment. The director is dressed the same as Yakomoto, the director in 'Erizabeth L', only he is blacked up.

DIRECTION:
African accent

TERRY JONES:
Cut there man! No! No good! How we going to get feeling of personal alienation of self from society with this load of Bulldog Drummond crap? When I was doing 'La Notte' wi' dat Monica Vitti gal she don't gimme none of this empire building shit, man ...

DIRECTION:
Camera pans slightly to reveal a door in jungle. It opens and an inspector enters.

ERIC IDLE:
Not so fast, Akarumba! Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Inspector Baboon of Scotland Yard's Special Fraud Film Director Squad, Jungle Division.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Baboon of the Yard!

ERIC IDLE:
Shut up!

DIRECTION:
shoots her

DIRECTION:
during this harangue the credits start to roll, music very faint beneath his words

DIRECTION:
the credits end; voice and picture start to fade

ERIC IDLE:
... Signor Antonioni first makes use of colour to underline...
