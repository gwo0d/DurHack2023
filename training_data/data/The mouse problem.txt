MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes. The Mouse Problem. This week 'The World Around Us' looks at the growing social phenomenon of Mice and Men. What makes a man want to be a mouse.

DIRECTION:
Interviewer, Harold Voice, sitting facing a confessor. The confessor is badly lit and is      turned away from camera.

DIRECTION:
very slowly and painfully

JOHN CLEESE:
Well it's not a question of wanting to be a mouse... it just sort of happens to you. All of a sudden you realize... that's what you want to be.

TERRY JONES:
And when did you first notice these... shall we say... tendencies?

JOHN CLEESE:
Well... I was about seventeen and some mates and me went to a party, and, er...      we had quite a lot to drink... and then some of the fellows there ... started handing ... cheese      around ... and well just out of curiosity I tried a bit ... and well that was that.

TERRY JONES:
And what else did these fellows do?

JOHN CLEESE:
Well some of them started dressing up as mice a bit ... and then when they'd got      the costumes on they started ... squeaking.

TERRY JONES:
Yes. And was that all?

JOHN CLEESE:
That was all.

TERRY JONES:
And what was your reaction to this?

JOHN CLEESE:
Well I was shocked. But, er... gradually I came to feel that I was more at ease ... with other mice.

DIRECTION:
Cut to linkman.

MICHAEL PALIN:
A typical case, whom we shall refer to as Mr A, although his real name is this:

DIRECTION:
and CAPTION:

DIRECTION:
ARTHUR JACKSON

DIRECTION:
32A MILTON AVENUE,

DIRECTION:
HOUNSLOW, MIDDLESEX.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What is it that attracts someone like mr. A to this way of life? I have with me a consultant psychiatrist.

DIRECTION:
The camera pulls back to reveal the psychiatrist who places in front og himself a notice saying 'The Amazing Kargol And Janet'.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, we've just heard a typical case history. I myself have over seven hundred similar histories, all fully documented. Would you care to choose one?

DIRECTION:
Janet (Carol), dressed in a showgirl's outfit, enters and offers linkman the case histories fanned out like cards, with one more prominent than the others; he picks it out.

DIRECTION:
without looking

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Mr Arthur Aldridge of Leamington.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, that's amazing, amazing. Thank you, Janet.

DIRECTION:
chord; Janet postures and exits

MICHAEL PALIN:
Kargol, speaking as a psychiatrist as opposed to a conjuror...

DIRECTION:
disappointed

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh...

MICHAEL PALIN:
...what makes certain men want to be mice?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, we psychiatrist have found that over 8% of the population will always be mice, I mean, after all, there's something of the mouse in all of us. I mean, how many of us can honestly say that at one time or another he hasn't felt sexually attracted to mice.

DIRECTION:
linkman looks puzzeld

DIRECTION:
linkman looks increasingly embarrassed

DIRECTION:
phone on desk rings; the linkman picks it up but does not answer it

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
The only way to bring the crime figures down is to reduce the number of offences - get it out in the open - I know I have.

DIRECTION:
replacing phone

MICHAEL PALIN:
The Amazing Kargol And Janet.  What a lot of people don't realize is that a mouse, once accepted, can fulfil a very useful role in society. Indeed there are examples throughout history of famous men now known to have been mice.

DIRECTION:
Cut to julius Caesar on beach. He shouts 'Veni Vidi, Vici'. Then he adds a furtive      squeak. Napoleon pulls slice of cheese out of jacket and bites into it.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And, of course, Hillaire Belloc. But what is the attitude...

Cut to man in a Viking helmet.

Eric Idle

ERIC IDLE:
... of the man in the street towards...

MICHAEL PALIN:
... this growing social problem?

DIRECTION:
Vox pops films.

ERIC IDLE:
Clamp down on them.

DIRECTION:
How?

ERIC IDLE:
I'd strangle them.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well speaking as a member of the Stock Exchange I would suck their brains out with a straw, sell the widows and orphans and go into South American Zinc.

TERRY JONES:
Yeh I'd, er, stuff sparrows down their throats, er, until the beaks stuck out through the, er, stomach walls.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh well I'm a chartered accountant, and consequently too boring to be of interest.

JOHN CLEESE:
I feel that these poor unfortunate people should be free to live the lives of their own choice.

TERRY JONES:
I'd split their nostrils open with a boat hook, I think.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well I mean, they can't help it, can they? But, er, there's nothing you can do about it. So er, I'd kill 'em.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Clearly the British public's view is a hostile one.

DIRECTION:
'HOSTILE'

MICHAEL PALIN:
But perhaps this is because so little is generally known of these mice men. We have      some film now taken of one of the notorious weekend mouse parties, where these disgusting      little perverts meet.

DIRECTION:
Cut to exterior house (night). The blinds are drawn so that only shadows of enormous      mice can be seen, holding slices of cheese and squeaking.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Mr A tells us what actually goes on at these mouse parties.

DIRECTION:
Cut to Mr A.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well first of all you get shown to your own private hole in the skirting board... then you      put the mouse skin on... then you scurry into the main room, and perhaps take a run in the      wheel.

MICHAEL PALIN:
The remainder of this film was taken secretly at one of these mouse parties by a      BBC cameraman posing as a vole. As usual we apologize for the poor quality of the film.

DIRECTION:
Very, poor quality film, shadowy shapes, the odd mouse glimpsed.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, er, then you steal some cheese, Brie or Camembert, or Cheddar or      Gouda, if you're on the harder stuff. You might go and see one of the blue cheese films...      there's a big clock in the middle of the room, and about 12:50 you climb up it and then      ...eventually, it strikes one... and you all run down.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a large matron with apron and cawing knife.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And what's that?

JOHN CLEESE:
That's the farmer's wife.

DIRECTION:
Cut to the linkman at desk.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Perhaps we need to know more of these mice men before we can really judge      them. Perhaps not. Anyway, our thirty minutes are up.

DIRECTION:
Sound of baa-ing. The linkman looks up in air, looks startled, pulls a gun from under the      desk and fires in the air. The body of a sheep falls to the floor.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Goodnight.
