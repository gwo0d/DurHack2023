MICHAEL PALIN:
Composer? Huh! I wouldn't wish it on my son. He's a sensitive boy, already. I'd rather he was a sewage attendant or a ratcatcher.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Aha! Rats at 42a Kartoffelnstrasse. Hey Mitzi! I gotta go to Potato Street.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Depressed by rats? Do mice get you down? Then why not visit Colin Mozart's Rodent Extermination Boutique. Rats extirpated, mice punished, voles torn apart by Colin Mozart, Munich's leading furry animal liquidator.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Colin Mozart.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, thank goodness you've come. We're having a terrible time with them bleeding rats. I think they live in his stupid piano already.

JOHN CLEESE:
Get out the bloody piano you stupid furry bucktoothed gits! Get out! Gott in Himmel. Get your stinking tail out of my face.

JOHN CLEESE:
Shut up!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
So anyway, Beethoven was rather glad when he went deaf.

ERIC IDLE:
Well, I was ever so glad they abolished hanging, you know, because that black cap just didn't suit me.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes. Do you remember the Glasgow treason trial?

ERIC IDLE:
Oh yes, I wore a body stocking all through it.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, hen, with the party afterwards.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, that's right. You were walking out with that very butch Clerk of the Court.

MICHAEL PALIN:
That's right. Ooh, he made me want to turn Queen's evidence.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, me too. One summing up and I'm anybody's.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Anyway, Bailie Anderson.

ERIC IDLE:
Ooh, her?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes. She's so strict. She was on at me for giving dolly sentences, you know, specially in that arson case.

ERIC IDLE:
What was the verdict?

MICHAEL PALIN:
They preferred the brown wig.

ERIC IDLE:
Mm. I love the Scottish Assizes. I know what they mean by a really well-hung jury.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ooh! Get back in the witness box, you're too sharp to live!

ERIC IDLE:
I'll smack your little botty!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ooh! and again.

ERIC IDLE:
Have you tried that new body rub JP's use?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I had a magistrate in Bradford yesterday.

ERIC IDLE:
Funnily enough I felt like one in a lunchtime recess today.

ERIC IDLE:
But the ones I really like are those voice over announcers on the BBC after the programs are over.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, aye, of course, they're as bent as safety pins.

ERIC IDLE:
I know, but they've got beautiful speaking voices, haven't they? 'And now a choice of viewing on BBC Television.'

MICHAEL PALIN:
'Here are tonight's football results.'
