DIRECTION:
Slow pan across idyllic countryside. We see a traditional eighteenth-century coach and horses travelling along the valley floor. Suddenly a highwayman, Dennis Moore, spurs his horse forward and rides up to the coach brandishing pistols.

JOHN CLEESE:
Stand and deliver! Drop that gun!

DIRECTION:
the coach comes to a halt; the drivers hold up their hands but a postillion reaches for a gun; Moore shoots him

DIRECTION:
every

DIRECTION:
heads are coming out of the coach and peering

JOHN CLEESE:
You see the three trees, the third from the left and back a bit - that one - I reckon I clould hit that four times out of five...on a good day. Say with this wind...say, say, seven times out of ten...

TERRY JONES:
What, that tree there?

JOHN CLEESE:
Which one?

TERRY JONES:
The big beech with the sort of bare branch coming out of the top left.

JOHN CLEESE:
No, no, no, not that one.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
No, no, he means the one over there. Look, you see that one.

TERRY JONES:
Yes.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Well now, go two along to the right.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Just near that little bush.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Well, it's the one just behind it.

TERRY JONES:
Ah! The elm.

JOHN CLEESE:
No, that's not an elm. An elm's got sort of great clumps of leaves like that. That's either a beech or a...er...hornbeam.

ERIC IDLE:
A hornbeam?

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, no not a hornbeam, What's the tree that has a leaf with sort of regular veins coming out and the veins go all the way out to the...

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Serrated?

JOHN CLEESE:
...to the serrated edges.

ERIC IDLE:
A willow!

JOHN CLEESE:
That's right.

ERIC IDLE:
That's nothing like a willow.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well it doesn't matter, anyway. I can hit it seven times out of ten, that's the point.

ERIC IDLE:
Never a willow.

JOHN CLEESE:
Shut up! This is a hold-up, not a botany lesson. Right, now my fine friends, no false moves please. I want you to hand over all the lupins you've got.

TERRY JONES:
Lupins?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, lupins. Come on, come on.

ERIC IDLE:
What do you mean, lupins?

JOHN CLEESE:
Don't try to play for time.

ERIC IDLE:
I'm not, you mean the flower lupin?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, that's right.

TERRY JONES:
Well, we haven't got any lupins.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Honestly.

JOHN CLEESE:
Look, my fine friends. I happen to know that this is the Lupin Express.

TERRY JONES:
You must be out of your tiny mind.

JOHN CLEESE:
Get out of the coach. Come on, get out!

DIRECTION:
they do so indicating that Moore is a loony; he dismounts and enters the coach; he immediately comes out with an enormous armful of lupins

DIRECTION:
he jumps on horse and rides away

TERRY JONES:
Well, so much for the lupins.

DIRECTION:
Montage of Dennis Moore, galloping through the sun-dappled glades, a little village, more glades and forrest and arriving at a little peasant-type woodcutter's hut where two terribly poor peasants greet him and recieve the lupins with a neutral reaction. During this the following song is heard.

DIRECTION:
Dennis Moore, Dennis Moore,

DIRECTION:
Galloping through the sward,

DIRECTION:
And his horse Concorde.

DIRECTION:
He steals from the rich and

DIRECTION:
Gives to the poor.

DIRECTION:
Mr Moore, Mr Moore, Mr Moore.

JOHN CLEESE:
Here we are, I'll be back.

DIRECTION:
Moore wheels round and rides off.

SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'THE END'
