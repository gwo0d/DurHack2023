DIRECTION:
Cut to Mrs Mock Tudor and Mrs Elizabeth III watching TV. There is a film of the motorway on it, filmed from the bank beside a bridge.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
At last they done been put on something interesting.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, most interesting.

DIRECTION:
Cut back to the programme planners conference.

DIRECTION:
reading figures

ERIC IDLE:
... and our figures show that the motorways are extremely popular. I mean, last time we showed a repeat of the Leicester bypass our ratings gave us 97,300,912, and ITV nought. So I do feel we ought to give B roads their own series.

TERRY JONES:
I'm sorry ... we just can't give you a bigger budget.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Budgie?

DIRECTION:
to the second planner

DIRECTION:
to the senior executive

ERIC IDLE:
Why not?

TERRY JONES:
We're not the only slice of the cake, you know.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Wouldn't mind a slice of cake. Nice chocolate cake ... delicious ...

MICHAEL PALIN:
I had a budgie once you know, amusing little chap, used to stick his head in a bell ... what was his name, now ... Joey? ... Xerxes? ...

ERIC IDLE:
We could repeat them ...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Re-heat them?

ERIC IDLE:
No, repeat them ...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You don't re-heat cakes. Not chocolate cakes.

TERRY JONES:
What, repeat the cakes?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Mr Heath, that was the name of the budgie.

DIRECTION:
looking at his watch

DIRECTION:
they all scramble madly to their feet

TERRY JONES:
Oh no it isn't, I was looking at the little hand that goes round very fast ...

DIRECTION:
Damn. Blast.

DIRECTION:
They sit down again reluctantly. There is a short pause.

ERIC IDLE:
I've got it. We can retitle the repeats.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What ... give them different names?

TERRY JONES:
Wouldn't that mean retitling them?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Brilliant!

TERRY JONES:
Right - all we need is new titles. And they must be damned new!

MICHAEL PALIN:
How about `Dad's Navy'?

TERRY JONES:
Mm, good, good.

ERIC IDLE:
`Up Your Mother Next Door.'

TERRY JONES:
Even better ...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
'Doctor At Bee'!

DIRECTION:
What?

DIRECTION:
There is a knock at the door.

ERIC IDLE:
Someone's knocking at the door.

TERRY JONES:
Quite like it - bit long, though, I think.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Far too long.

MICHAEL PALIN:
`I Married Lucy.'

TERRY JONES:
Hasn't that been done?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, yes, a long time ago, though, they'd never remember it.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
`Doctor at Three'!

TERRY JONES:
What?

ERIC IDLE:
I think someone's knocking at the door.

TERRY JONES:
That's even longer!

MICHAEL PALIN:
`I Married A Tree.'

TERRY JONES:
`And Mother Makes Tree.'

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
`Doctor At Cake'!

DIRECTION:
Continuous knocking on the door.

ERIC IDLE:
Look! I'm not absolutely certain, but, well I do rather get the impression that there is someone actually knocking on the door at this very moment.

TERRY JONES:
That's ridiculous. Half the programme gone. Stop lengthening it!

DIRECTION:
desperate

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
`I Married A Cake'?

DIRECTION:
over excited

MICHAEL PALIN:
`I Married Three Rabbit Jelly Moulds'!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Prefer a cake ... specially chocky cake ...

DIRECTION:
There is by now a constant hammering.

DIRECTION:
yells from outside door

TERRY GILLIAM:
Open the sodding door!

TERRY JONES:
No, no. You can't say `sodding' on the television.

DIRECTION:
All shake their heads. The door is broken in. Enter a neo-fascist-looking security man in a wheelchair with an oriental sword through his head.

TERRY JONES:
You're supposed to knock!

TERRY GILLIAM:
Sorry, sir, but there's trouble at studio five!

MICHAEL PALIN:
You're in security, aren't you?

TERRY GILLIAM:
Yes, sir.

DIRECTION:
triumphantly

DIRECTION:
he smiles victoriously at others

TERRY GILLIAM:
Sir! It's the World War series in studio five - they're not taking it seriously any more.

ERIC IDLE:
You're not allowed to suggest programme titles!

DIRECTION:
switching on a TV set

TERRY GILLIAM:
Look!

DIRECTION:
They rush to the monitor. One of them brushes the oriental sword which is through his head.

TERRY GILLIAM:
Ow! Mind me war wound!

DIRECTION:
That's it! Very good title!

DIRECTION:
On the screen we see the court martial in progress as we saw it earlier in the show, with the whole court singing.

DIRECTION:
Anything goes in. Anything goes out!

DIRECTION:
Fish, bananas, old pyjamas,

DIRECTION:
Mutton, beef and trout!

DIRECTION:
Anything goes in. Anything goes out! etc.

DIRECTION:
ANIMATION:

DIRECTION:
'What a lovely day'.
