There now follows a Party Political Broadcast on behalf of the Conservative and Unionist Party.

Cut to a politician sitting on a chair. He is in fact in a rehearsal room, but we don't see this for the first six lines.

And point 'unemployment' with your finger.

JOHN CLEESE:
I see. I can do it when you're here.

ERIC IDLE:
I won't be far away. All right, Neville love, we're going from 'unemployment' through 'pensions' into 'good government is strong government' and the walk down, all fight? And ... cue, love.

DIRECTION:
They give an awful wave and cheesecake smile at the end, and hold it.

ERIC IDLE:
That's where you'll get the bunting and the ticker tape, Chris. Right, big smiles, everybody, remember you're cabinet ministers. And relax.

DIRECTION:
only now do they stop smiling and waving

ERIC IDLE:
Lovely, it's trans at eight, so nobody be late.

DIRECTION:
The camera crabs away. Through an open door it passes we see two Labour MPs, one on points, the other walking around with his hands on his hips. They are in leotards and dancers' leg warmers.

Cut to a studio: a silhouette of a man sitting on a high stool with book.
