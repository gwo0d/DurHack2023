DIRECTION:
The loony leans into shot and waves. Fade to black. Fade up on close up of picture of Everest. Pull back to reveal travel agent's office.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Mount Everest, forbidding, aloof, terrifyring. The highest place on earth. No I'm sorry we don't go there. No.

DIRECTION:
By the time Bounder is saying his last sentence the camera has revealed the office and Bounder himself sitting at a desk. Bounder now replaces the telephone into which he has been speaking. After a pause the tourist - Mr Smoke-Too-Much - enters the office and approaches Mr Bounder's secretary.

ERIC IDLE:
Good morning.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh good morning.

DIRECTION:
sexily

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Do you want to go upstairs?

ERIC IDLE:
What?

DIRECTION:
brightly

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Or have you come to arrange a holiday?

ERIC IDLE:
Er.......to arrange a holiday.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh sorry.

ERIC IDLE:
What's all this about going upstairs?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh, nothing, nothing. Now where were you thinking of going?

ERIC IDLE:
India.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Ah one of our adventure holidays!

ERIC IDLE:
Yes!

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Well you'd better see Mr Bounder about that. Mr Bounder, this gentleman is interested in the India Overland.

DIRECTION:
Walks over to Bounder's desk where he is greeted by Bounder.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah good morning. I'm Bounder of Adventure.

ERIC IDLE:
My name is Smoke-Too-Much.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What?

ERIC IDLE:
My name is Smoke-Too-Much. Mr Smoke-Too-Much.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well you'd better cut down a little then.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You'd better cut down a little then.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh I see! Cut down a bit, for Smoke-Too-Much.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, he he...I expect you get people making jokes about your name all the time, eh?

ERIC IDLE:
No, no actually. Actually, it never struck me before. Smoke...too...much!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Anyway, you're interested in one of our adventure holidays, eh?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes. I saw your advert in the bolour supplement.

MICHAEL PALIN:
The what?

ERIC IDLE:
The bolour supplement.

MICHAEL PALIN:
The colour supplement?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes. I'm sorry I can't say the letter 'B'.

MICHAEL PALIN:
C?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes that's right. It's all due to a trauma I suffered when I was a sboolboy. I was attacked by a bat.

MICHAEL PALIN:
A cat?

ERIC IDLE:
No a bat.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Can you say the letter 'K'?

ERIC IDLE:
Oh yes, Khaki, king, kettle, Kuwait, Keble Bollege Oxford.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Why don't you say the letter 'K' instead of the letter 'C'?

ERIC IDLE:
What you mean.....spell bolour with a K?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes.

ERIC IDLE:
Kolour. Oh that's very good, I never thought of that.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Anyway, about the holiday..

ERIC IDLE:
Well I saw your adverts in the paper and I've been on package tours several times, you see, and I decided that this was for me.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah good.
