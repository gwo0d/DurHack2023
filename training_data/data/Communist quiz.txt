ERIC IDLE:
Good evening. Tonight is indeed a unique occasion in the history of television. We are very privileged, and deeply honoured to have with us in the studio, Karl Marx, founder of modern socialism, and author of the 'Communist Manifesto'.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, Mao Tse-tung?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes it was indeed. Well challenged.

ERIC IDLE:
The development of the industrial proletariat is conditioned by what other development?

TERRY JONES:
The development of the industrial bourgeoisie.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, yes, it is indeed. You're on your way to the lounge suite, Karl. Question number two. The struggle of class against class is a what struggle? A what struggle?

TERRY JONES:
A political struggle.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, yes! One final question Karl and the beautiful lounge suite will be yours... Are you going to have a go?

ERIC IDLE:
You're a brave man. Karl Marx, your final question, who won the Cup Final in 1949?

TERRY JONES:
The workers' control of the means of production? The struggle of the urban proletariat?

ERIC IDLE:
No. It was in fact, Wolverhampton Wanderers who beat Leicester 3-1.
