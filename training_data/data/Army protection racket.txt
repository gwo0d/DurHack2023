DIRECTION:
Stock film of the army. Tanks rolling, troops moving forward etc. Stirring military music.

JOHN CLEESE:
In 1943, a group of British Army Officers working deep behind enemy lines, carried out one of the most dangerous and heroic raids in the history of warfare. But that's as maybe. And now . . .

Cut to colonel's office. Colonel is seated at desk.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Come in, what do you want?

DIRECTION:
Private Watkins enters and salutes.

ERIC IDLE:
I'd like to leave the army please, sir.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Good heavens man, why?

ERIC IDLE:
It's dangerous.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What?

ERIC IDLE:
There are people with guns out there, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
Real guns, sir. Not toy ones, sir. Proper ones, sir. They've all got 'em. All of 'em, sir. And some of 'em have got tanks.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Watkins, they

DIRECTION:
are

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
on our side.

ERIC IDLE:
And grenades, sir. And machine guns, sir. So I'd like to leave, sir, before I get killed, please.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Watkins, you've only been in the army a day.

ERIC IDLE:
I know sir but people get killed, properly dead, sir, no barley cross fingers, sir. A bloke was telling me, if you're in the army and there's a war you have to go and fight.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
That's true.

ERIC IDLE:
Well I mean, blimey, I mean if it was a big war somebody could be hurt.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Watkins why did you

DIRECTION:
join

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
the army?

ERIC IDLE:
For the water-skiing and for the travel, sir. And

DIRECTION:
not

ERIC IDLE:
for the killing, sir. I asked them to put it on my form, sir - no killing.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Watkins are you a pacifist?

ERIC IDLE:
No sir, I'm not a pacifist, sir. I'm a coward.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
That's a very silly line. Sit down.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes sir. Silly, sir.

DIRECTION:
sits in corner

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Awfully bad.

DIRECTION:
Knock at the door, sergeant enters, and salutes.

JOHN CLEESE:
Two civilian gentlemen to see you ... sir!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Show them in please, sergeant.

JOHN CLEESE:
Mr Dino Vercotti and Mr Luigi Vercotti.

DIRECTION:
The Vercotti brothers enter. They wear Mafia suits and dark glasses.

TERRY JONES:
Good morning, colonel.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Good morning gentlemen. Now what can I do for you.

DIRECTION:
looking round office casually

MICHAEL PALIN:
You've ... you've got a nice army base here, colonel.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes.

MICHAEL PALIN:
We wouldn't want anything to happen to it.

TERRY JONES:
No, what my brother means is it would be a shame if...

DIRECTION:
he knocks something off mantel

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh.

TERRY JONES:
Oh sorry, colonel.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well don't worry about that. But please do sit down.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, we prefer to stand, thank you, colonel.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
All right. All right. But what do you want?

TERRY JONES:
What do we want, ha ha ha.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ha ha ha, very good, colonel.

TERRY JONES:
The colonel's a joker, Luigi.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Explain it to the colonel, Dino.

TERRY JONES:
How many tanks you got, colonel?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
About five hundred altogether.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Five hundred! Hey!

TERRY JONES:
You ought to be careful, colonel.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
We are careful, extremely careful.

TERRY JONES:
'Cos things

DIRECTION:
break

TERRY JONES:
, don't they?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Break?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well everything breaks, don't it colonel.

DIRECTION:
he breaks something on desk

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh dear.

TERRY JONES:
Oh see my brother's clumsy colonel, and when he gets unhappy he breaks things. Like say, he don't feel the army's playing fair by him, he may start breaking things, colonel.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What is all this about?

MICHAEL PALIN:
How many men you got here, colonel?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, er ... seven thousand infantry, six hundred artillery, and er, two divisions of paratroops.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Paratroops, Dino.

TERRY JONES:
Be a shame if someone was to set fire to

DIRECTION:
them

TERRY JONES:
.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Set

DIRECTION:
fire

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
to them?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Fires happen, colonel.

TERRY JONES:
Things burn.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Look, what is all this about?

TERRY JONES:
My brother and I have got a little proposition for you colonel.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Could save you a lot of bother.

TERRY JONES:
I mean you're doing all right here aren't you, colonel.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well suppose some of your tanks was to get broken and troops started getting lost, er, fights started breaking out during general inspection, like.

TERRY JONES:
It wouldn't be good for business would it, colonel?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Are you threatening me?

TERRY JONES:
Oh, no, no, no.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Whatever made you think that, colonel?

TERRY JONES:
The colonel doesn't think we're nice people, Luigi.

MICHAEL PALIN:
We're your buddies, colonel.

TERRY JONES:
We want to look after you.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Look after me?

MICHAEL PALIN:
We can guarantee you that not a single armoured division will get done over for fifteen bob a week.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no, no.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Twelve and six.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Eight and six ... five bob...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no this is silly.

TERRY JONES:
What's silly?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, the whole premise is silly and it's very badly written. I'm the senior officer here and I haven't had a funny line yet. So I'm stopping it.

TERRY JONES:
You can't do that!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I've done it. The sketch is over.

ERIC IDLE:
I want to leave the army please sir, it's dangerous.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Look, I stopped

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's only 'cos you couldn't think of a punch line.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Not true, not true. It's time for the cartoon. Cue telecine, ten, nine, eight...

DIRECTION:
Cut to telecine countdown.

TERRY JONES:
The general public's not going to understand this, are they?
