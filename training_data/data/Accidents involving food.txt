MICHAEL PALIN:
My rubber instep caught on the rear mudguard stanchion and...

TERRY JONES:
Really? And what happened to the corned beef rolls?

MICHAEL PALIN:
The corned beef rolls squashed out of all...here, how did you know about the corned beef rolls?

TERRY JONES:
I noticed them - or what remained of them - in the road. I noticed also that the lemon curd tart had sustained some superficial damage.

MICHAEL PALIN:
That's right. The curd had become...

TERRY JONES:
Detached from the pastry base.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Absolutely right, yes.

TERRY JONES:
Otherwise the contents of the sandwich box were relatively unharmed, although I detected small particles of bitumen in the chocolate kup kakes.

MICHAEL PALIN:
But they were wrapped in foil!

TERRY JONES:
Not the hard chocolate top, I'm afraid.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, that's the bit I like.

TERRY JONES:
The sausage roll, the crisps and ginger bisquit were unscathed.

MICHAEL PALIN:
How do you know so much about cycling?

TERRY JONES:
Well, I'm making a special study of accidents involving food.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Really?

TERRY JONES:
Yes, do you know that in our laboratories, we have developed a cheese sandwich that can withstand an impact of 4,000 pounds per square inch?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good heavens!

TERRY JONES:
Amazing, isn't it? We have also developed a tomato which can eject itself when an accident is imminent.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Even if it's inside an egg and tomato roll?

TERRY JONES:
Anywhere! Even if it's in your stomach, and it senses an accident it will come up your throat and out of the window. Do you realise what this means?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Safer food?

TERRY JONES:
Exactly! No longer will food be squashed, crushed and damaged, by the ignorance and stupidity of the driver!

TERRY JONES:
Whole picnics will be built to withstand the most enormous forces! Snacks will be safer than ever! An simple pot of salad dressing, treated in our laboratories, has been subjected to the impact of a 4,000 pound steam hammer every day for the last sixteen years and has it broken?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Er....well...

TERRY JONES:
Yes, of course it has...but there are other ideas - the safety straps for sardines for instance.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Here, that tomato just ejected itself.

TERRY JONES:
Really?
