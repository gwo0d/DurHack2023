DIRECTION:
Cut to a polite, well dressed assistant at a counter with a big sign saying 'End of Show Department' behind him.

TERRY JONES:
Well it is one of our cheapest, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
What else have you got?

TERRY JONES:
Well, there's the long slow pull-out, sir, you know, the camera tracks back and back and mixes...

DIRECTION:
As he speaks we pull out and mix through to the exterior of the store. Mix through to even wider zoom ending up in aerial view of London. It stops abruptly and we cut back to Chris.

ERIC IDLE:
No, have you got anything more exciting?

TERRY JONES:
How about a chase?

DIRECTION:
The manager and the toupee assistants suddenly, appear at a door.

DIRECTION:
There he is!

DIRECTION:
Exciting chase music. They pursue Chris out of the hall and into another part of the store. Then cut back to Chris at counter.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, no, no, no.

TERRY JONES:
Walking into the sunset?

ERIC IDLE:
What's that one?

DIRECTION:
Dramatic sunset shot on a beach. We can just see the back of Chris and the assistant as they walk together towards the setting sun. The assistant is gesturing and describing it.

TERRY JONES:
You know ... two lone figures silhouetted against the dying rays of the setting sun. The music swells, you've got a lump in your throat and a tear in your eye...

DIRECTION:
Cut back to the store.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh no.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, pity, I rather like that one...

ERIC IDLE:
They're all a bit off the point, you see.

TERRY JONES:
Well there is one that ties up the whole Michael Ellis thing, but....

ERIC IDLE:
But what... ?

TERRY JONES:
Oh, no, nothing, nothing...

ERIC IDLE:
Look, who is this Michael Ellis?

TERRY JONES:
How about a happy ending, sir?

DIRECTION:
A girl rushes up to Chris and flings her arms around him.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh Chris! Thank God you're safe.

TERRY JONES:
No, you wouldn't want that, would you.

DIRECTION:
This time we see the girl has disappeared.

ERIC IDLE:
Why wouldn't I want that?

TERRY JONES:
What about summing up from the panel? That's cheap. You know - the big match experts.

DIRECTION:
Panel in typical football panel set. Malcolm Allison, Brian Clough, and huge still of Jimmy Hill on set behind.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes. It was quite a good show. I think that the Michael Ellis character was a little overdone.

ERIC IDLE:
Well, I don't agree with that, Malcolm, quite frankly the only bit I liked was this bit with me in it now.

TERRY JONES:
No? Slow fade?

DIRECTION:
The picture begins to fade.

ERIC IDLE:
Nnnn... no.

DIRECTION:
The picture comes up again.

TERRY JONES:
Well, how about a sudden ending?

DIRECTION:
Blackout.
