TERRY JONES:
Well it is one of our cheapest, sir.

ERIC IDLE:
What else have you got?

TERRY JONES:
Well, there's the long slow pull-out, sir, you know, the camera tracks back and back and mixes...

ERIC IDLE:
No, have you got anything more exciting?

TERRY JONES:
How about a chase?

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, no, no, no.

TERRY JONES:
Walking into the sunset?

ERIC IDLE:
What's that one?

TERRY JONES:
You know ... two lone figures silhouetted against the dying rays of the setting sun. The music swells, you've got a lump in your throat and a tear in your eye...

ERIC IDLE:
Oh no.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, pity, I rather like that one...

ERIC IDLE:
They're all a bit off the point, you see.

TERRY JONES:
Well there is one that ties up the whole Michael Ellis thing, but....

ERIC IDLE:
But what... ?

TERRY JONES:
Oh, no, nothing, nothing...

ERIC IDLE:
Look, who is this Michael Ellis?

TERRY JONES:
How about a happy ending, sir?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh Chris! Thank God you're safe.

TERRY JONES:
No, you wouldn't want that, would you.

ERIC IDLE:
Why wouldn't I want that?

TERRY JONES:
What about summing up from the panel? That's cheap. You know - the big match experts.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes. It was quite a good show. I think that the Michael Ellis character was a little overdone.

ERIC IDLE:
Well, I don't agree with that, Malcolm, quite frankly the only bit I liked was this bit with me in it now.

TERRY JONES:
No? Slow fade?

ERIC IDLE:
Nnnn... no.

TERRY JONES:
Well, how about a sudden ending?
