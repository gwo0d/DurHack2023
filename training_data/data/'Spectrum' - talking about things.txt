MICHAEL PALIN:
Good evening. Tonight 'Spectrum' looks at one of the major problems in the world today - that old vexed question of what is going on. Is there still time to confront it, let alone solve it, or is it too late? What are the figures, what are the facts, what do people mean when they talk about things? Alexander Hardacre of the Economic Affairs Bureau.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
In this graph, this column represents 23% of the population. This column represents 28% of the population, and this column represents 43% of the population.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Telling figures indeed, but what do they mean to you, what do they mean to me, what do they mean to the average man in the street? With me now is Professor Tiddles of Leeds University...

MICHAEL PALIN:
... Professor, you've spent many years researching into things, what do you think?

JOHN CLEESE:
I think it's too early to tell.

MICHAEL PALIN:
'Too early to tell' ... too early to say... it means the same thing. The word 'say' is the same as the word 'tell'. They're not spelt the same, but they mean the same. It's an identical situation, we have with 'ship' and 'boat'

MICHAEL PALIN:
But the real question remains. What is the solution, if any, to this problem? What can we do? What am I saying? Why am I sitting in this chair? Why am I on this programme? And what am I going to say next? Here to answer this is a professional cricketer.

ERIC IDLE:
I can say nothing at this point.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, you were wrong... Professor?

JOHN CLEESE:
Hello.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hello. So... where do we stand? Where do we stand? Where do we sit? Where do we come? Where do we go? What do we do? What do we say? What do we eat? What do we drink? What do we think? What do we do?

TERRY JONES:
Sorry!
