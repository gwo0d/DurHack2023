MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Dead Indian.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Have you recently bought a new cooker, sir?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ah well, this is your free dead Indian, as advertised...

MICHAEL PALIN:
I didn't see that in the adverts...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, it's in the very small print, you see, sir, so as not to affect the sales.

MICHAEL PALIN:
We've no room.

JOHN CLEESE:
That's all right - you can put the dead Indian in the spare room on top of the dung.

DIRECTION:
Me ... heap dizzy.

MICHAEL PALIN:
He's not dead!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh well, that's probably a faulty cooker.

DIRECTION:
The phone rings. The wife goes to answer it.

JOHN CLEESE:
Have you, er... you read and enjoyed 'The French Lieutenant's Woman', then?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No.

JOHN CLEESE:
No... still, it's worth it for the dung, isn't it?

DIRECTION:
Darling, it's the Milk Marketing Board. For every two cartons of single cream we get the M4 motorway.

DIRECTION:
Cut to host and hostess standing bewildered in the middle of a motorway. Beside them is a steaming pile of dung, and a dead Indian. They look round in amazement. A police car roars up to them and two policemen leap out.

ERIC IDLE:
Are you Mr and Mrs P. Forbes of 7, the Studios, Elstree?

ERIC IDLE:
Right, well, get in the car. We've won you in a police raffle.

DIRECTION:
Speeded up, they are bundled into the car. Cut to inspector.

TERRY JONES:
Yes! This couple is just one of the prizes in this year's Police Raffle. Other prizes include two years for breaking and entering, a crate of search warrants, a 'What's all this then?' T-shirt and a weekend for two with a skinhead of your own choice.

DIRECTION:
