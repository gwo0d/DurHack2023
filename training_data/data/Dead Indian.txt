MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Dead Indian.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Have you recently bought a new cooker, sir?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ah well, this is your free dead Indian, as advertised...

MICHAEL PALIN:
I didn't see that in the adverts...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:

JOHN CLEESE:
That's all right - you can put the dead Indian in the spare room on top of the dung.

MICHAEL PALIN:
He's not dead!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh well, that's probably a faulty cooker.

JOHN CLEESE:
Have you, er... you read and enjoyed 'The French Lieutenant's Woman', then?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No.

JOHN CLEESE:
No... still, it's worth it for the dung, isn't it?

ERIC IDLE:
Are you Mr and Mrs P. Forbes of 7, the Studios, Elstree?

ERIC IDLE:

TERRY JONES:
Yes! This couple is just one of the prizes in this year's Police Raffle. Other prizes include two years for breaking and entering, a crate of search warrants, a 'What's all this then?' T-shirt and a weekend for two with a skinhead of your own choice.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And that's not all. Three fabulous new prizes have just been added, a four-month supply of interesting undergarments

MICHAEL PALIN:
, and a hand-painted scene of Arabian splendour, complete with silly walk.
