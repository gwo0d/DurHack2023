DIRECTION:
Theme music. 'Coronation Scot' as used in 'Paul Temple' for years.

DIRECTION:
You are Mary, Queen of Scots?

DIRECTION:
I am!

DIRECTION:
There now follows a series of noises indicating that Mary is getting the shit knocked out of her. Thumps, bangs, slaps, pneumatic drilling, sawing, flogging, shooting, all interlaced with Mary's screams. The two women listen calmly. After a few seconds: fade as the signature tune 'Coronation Scot' is brought up loudly to denote ending of episode.

JOHN CLEESE:
Episode two of 'The Death of Mary, Queen of Scots', can be heard on Radio 4 almost immediately.

DIRECTION:
One of the women goes over to the set and switches it over. As she goes back to her seat from the radio we hear the theme music again, fading out as the sounds of violence and screaming start again and continue unabated in vigour.

DIRECTION:
I think she's dead.

DIRECTION:
No I'm not!

DIRECTION:
After a time, sounds of violence and screaming start again rapidly fading under the tune of 'Coronation Scot'.

JOHN CLEESE:
That was episode two of 'The Death of Mary, Queen of Scots', adapted for radio by Bernard Hollowood and Brian London. And now, Radio Four will explode.

DIRECTION:
the radio explodes
