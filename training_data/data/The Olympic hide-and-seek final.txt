ERIC IDLE:
Hello, good afternoon and welcome to the second leg of the Olympic final of the men's Hide-and-Seek here in the heart of Britain's London. We'll be starting in just a couple of moments from now, and there you can see the two competitors Francisco Huron the Paraguayan, who in this leg is the seeker

ERIC IDLE:
our own Don Roberts from Hinckley in Leicestershire who, his trainer tells me, is at the height of his self-secreting form. And now in the first leg, which ended on Wednesday, Don succeeded in finding the Paraguayan in the new world record time of 11 years, 2 months, 26 days, 9 hours, 3 minutes, 27.4 seconds, in a sweetshop in Kilmarnock. And now they're under starter's orders.

TERRY JONES:
Uno, dos, tres, quattro, cinque, seis, siete, ocho, nueve, diez ...

TERRY JONES:
... trientay dos, trientay tres, trientay quattro...

ERIC IDLE:
Well Don's off to a really great start there. Remember the Paraguayan has got 11 years, 2 months, 26 days, 9 hours...

ERIC IDLE:
3 minutes, 27.4 seconds to beat.

TERRY JONES:
Neuvecian no nuevetay ocho, nuevecientas nuevente ye nueve, mil.

TERRY JONES:
Coming!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, we'll be taking you back there as soon as there are any developments.

MICHAEL PALIN:
We've just heard that something is happening in the Hide-and-Seek final, so let's go straight over there.

ERIC IDLE:
Hello again, and welcome to Madagascar, where Francisco Huron is seeking Don Roberts. And I've just been told that he has been told that he has been unofficially described as 'cold'. Ah, wait a minute.

ERIC IDLE:
I've just been told that Huron has requested a plane ticket for Budapest! So he's definitely getting warmer. So we'll be back again in just a few years.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Really beginning to hot up now.

ERIC IDLE:
So here we are on the very last day of this fantastic final. Huron now has less than twelve hours left to find British ace Don Roberts. Early this morning he finished combing the outskirts of Lisbon and now he seems to have staked everything on one final desperate seek here in the Tagus valley. But Roberts is over fifteen hundred miles away, and it's beginning to look all over, bar the shouting. The sands of time are running out for this delving dago, this savior of seek, perspicacious Paraguayan. He's still desperately cold and it's beginning to look like another gold for Britain.

MICHAEL PALIN:
The official result of the World Hide-and-Seek, Mr Don Roberts from Hinckley, Leicestershire, 11 years, 2 months, 26 days, 9 hours, 3 minutes, 27 seconds. Mr Francisco Huron, Paraguay, 11 years, a months, 26 days, 9 hours, 3 minutes, 27 seconds. The result - a tie.

JOHN CLEESE:
A tie! Well what a fantastic result. Well the replay will start tomorrow at 7.30 a.m.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well hello again .... nice to be back ... glad to see the series has been doing well. Well now, sorry about Mon-trerx.

MICHAEL PALIN:
That was a little item entitled Hide-and-Seek - very anarchic, very effective, not quite my cup of tea, but very nice for the younger people. Well, the next item the boys have put together takes place in a sitting room. Sorry it's just a sitting room, but the bank account's a bit low after the appallingly expensive production of 'Clochmerle'...

ERIC IDLE:
This is a totally free interruption and no money has exchanged hands whatever.
