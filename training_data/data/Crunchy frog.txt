JOHN CLEESE:
Mr Milton? You are sole proprietor and owner of the Whizzo Chocolate Company?

TERRY JONES:
I am.

JOHN CLEESE:
Superintendent Parrot and I are from the hygiene squad.We want to have a word with you about your box of chocolates entitled the Whizzo Quality Assortment.

TERRY JONES:
Ah, yes.

JOHN CLEESE:
If I may begin at the beginning. First there is the Cherry Fondue. This is extremely nasty, but we can't prosecute you for that.

TERRY JONES:
Agreed.

JOHN CLEESE:
Next we have number four, 'Crunchy Frog'.

TERRY JONES:
An, yes.

JOHN CLEESE:
Am I right in thinking there's a real frog in here?

TERRY JONES:
Yes. A little one.

JOHN CLEESE:
What sort of frog?

TERRY JONES:
A dead frog.

JOHN CLEESE:
Is it cooked?

TERRY JONES:
No.

JOHN CLEESE:
What, a raw frog?

TERRY JONES:
We use only the finest baby frogs, dew-picked and flown from Iraq, cleansed in the finest quality spring water, lightly killed, and then sealed in a succulent Swiss quintuple smooth treble cream milk chocolate envelope, and lovingly frosted with glucose.

JOHN CLEESE:
That's as may be, but it's still a frog!

TERRY JONES:
What else?

JOHN CLEESE:
Well don't you even take the bones out?

TERRY JONES:
If we took the bones out it wouldn't be crunchy would it?

JOHN CLEESE:
Superintendent Parrot ate one of those.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Excuse me a moment.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, the Superintendent thought it was an almond whirl. People won't expect there to be a frog in there. They're bound to think it's some sort of mock frog.

TERRY JONES:
Mock frog? We use no artificial preservatives or additives of any kind!

JOHN CLEESE:
Nevertheless, I must warn you that in future you should delete the words 'crunchy frog', and replace them with the legend, 'crunchy raw unboned real dead frog' if you want to avoid prosecution.

TERRY JONES:
What about our sales?

JOHN CLEESE:
I'm not interested in your sales! I have to protect the general public! Now what about this one.

JOHN CLEESE:
What sort of confection is this?

TERRY JONES:
We use choicest juicy chunks of fresh Cornish ram's bladder, emptied, steamed, flavoured with sesame seeds, whipped into a fondue and garnished with lark's vomit.

JOHN CLEESE:
Larks vomit?

TERRY JONES:
Correct.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well it don't say nothing about that here.

TERRY JONES:
Oh yes it does, on the bottom of the box, after monosodium glutamate.

JOHN CLEESE:
Wel I hardly think this is good enough. I think it's be more appropriate if the box bore a great red label warning lark's vomit.

TERRY JONES:
Our sales would plummet!

JOHN CLEESE:
Well why don't you move into more conventional areas of confectionary, like praline or lime cream; a very popular flavor, I'm lead to understand.

JOHN CLEESE:
anthrax ripple! What's this one: 'spring surprise'?

TERRY JONES:
Ah - now, that's our speciality - covered with darkest creamy chocolate. When you pop it into your mouth steel bolts spring out and plunge straight through both cheeks.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well where's the pleasure in that? If people place a nice chocky in their mouth, they don't want their cheeks pierced. In any case this is an inadequate description of the sweetmeat. I shall have to ask you to accompany me to the station.

TERRY JONES:
It's a fair cop.

JOHN CLEESE:
Stop talking to the camera.

TERRY JONES:
I'm sorry.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
If only the general public would take more care when buying its sweeties, it would reduce the number of man-hours lost to the nation and they would spend less time having their stomachs pumped and sitting around in public lavatories.

JOHN CLEESE:
The BBC would like to apologize for the extremely poor quality of the next announcement, only he's not at all well.
