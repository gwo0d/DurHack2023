DIRECTION:
Cut to stock film of people queuing at an exhibition hall.

ERIC IDLE:
Well it may be the end of that, but it's certainly far from the end of - well in fact it's the beginning - well not quite the beginning - well certainly nearer the beginning than the end - well yes damn it, it is to all intents and purposes the beginning of this year's Ideal Loon Exhibition, sponsored by the 'Daily Express'.

DIRECTION:
cut to interior of hall, people pouring through the doors; above their heads it says 'Ideal Loon Exhibition

DIRECTION:
quick flash of Edward Heath opening something

DIRECTION:
Kevin is in a roped-off exhibition area; with a number in front of him; people are walking past looking at him with programmes; he is dressed in Australian bush gear and he is leaning his forehead against a goldfish bowl on a four-foot-six plinth

DIRECTION:
again in an exhibition stand with a number in front; there is a screen which is higher than their heads, but it is cut off at knee height so you can see two pairs of legs, one female, totally bare, one male wearing some enormous boots, no socks

DIRECTION:
on the stand five men dressed in Breton berets, striped French shirts, silly moustaches, with baguettes; in unison they make the silly sign, counting the while 'un, deux, trois'

DIRECTION:
quite a crowd watch this; again a roped-off exhibit, Brian (Graham) is suspended from the ceilling by two car tyres; he lies there smoking a pipe; underneath him there is a small opened tin, with 'veal' on the side

DIRECTION:
a very large man (John) dressed as a Scotsman in front of a sign saying 'Scotsman with Nae Trews Exhibit, Sponsored by Natural Gas'; an enormously long line of middle-aged pepperpots stand waiting in a queue; eath in turn lifts up a comer of Scotsman's kilt, has a tiny peek and walks off

DIRECTION:
four Italian priests standing up to their chests in a large vat of custard; in front of them it says 'Italian Priests in custard'; they are animatedly discussing vital matters; hung behind them is a sign saying 'Italy, Land of Custard'

DIRECTION:
a dozen people in blazers, flannels and white pumps are vigorously counter-marching, whilst Souza's Star Spangled Banner blares out; they are holding various items of plumbing, lengths of piping, a toilet, a bidet, a bath, back scrubbers, loofahs, shower attachments, hand basins, etc.

DIRECTION:
cut to pantomime goose on horseback

ERIC IDLE:
But the climax of the whole event is the judging.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a sort of Miss World cat-walk. A judge appears holding number 41. A band plays 'A pretty girl is like a melody'.

JOHN CLEESE:
Mr Justice Burke.

DIRECTION:
the judge walks down, turns slightly at the edge of the stage, puts a knee forward and makes a cheesecake smile

DIRECTION:
the judge on the stage is joined by five others in full judicial robes, with wigs, each holding a number

JOHN CLEESE:
And the winner is - number 41, Mr Justice Burke.

DIRECTION:
The winner reacts by bursting into tears. The others look rather sad. Cut to a still picture of Mr Justice Burke in bed having breakfast the next morning. He is still wearing his robes and wig but he has a sceptre and a terrible tiara crown on. This picture is in black and white and is large on the front page of a newspaper. The headline is 'Justice seen to be done'. A subheading says 'British Justice Triumphs'. This newspaper page takes us off into a couple of minutes of animation.
