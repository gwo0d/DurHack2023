DIRECTION:
Pull back to reveal 'The End' is on TV in the house of Mrs Trepidatious. Another old ratbag enters and sits opposite Mrs Trepidatious.

ERIC IDLE:
Morning, Mrs Trepidatious.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, I don't know what's good about it, my right arm's hanging off something awful.

ERIC IDLE:
Oh, you want to have that seen to.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What, by that Dr Morrison? He's killed more patients than I've had severe boils.

ERIC IDLE:
What do the stars say?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, Petula Clark says burst them early, but David Frost...

ERIC IDLE:
No, the stars in the paper, you cloth-eared heap of anteater's catarrh, the zodiacal signs, the horoscopic fates, the astrological portents, the omens, the genethliac prognostications, the mantalogical harbingers, the vaticinal utterances, the fatidical premonitory uttering of the mantalogical omens - what do the bleeding stars in the paper predict, forecast, prophesy, foretell, prognosticate...

DIRECTION:
A big sheet is lowered with the words on.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And this is where you at home can join in.

ERIC IDLE:
... forebode, bode, augur, spell, foretoken,

DIRECTION:
the audience joins in

ERIC IDLE:
presage, portend, foreshow, foreshadow, forerun, herald, point to, betoken, indicate!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I don't know.

DIRECTION:
The sheet is raised again.

ERIC IDLE:
What are you?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'm Nesbitt.

ERIC IDLE:
There's not a zodiacal sign called Nesbitt...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
All right, Derry and Toms.

DIRECTION:
surveying paper

ERIC IDLE:
Aquarius, Scorpio, Virgo, Derry and Toms. April 29th to March 22nd. Even dates only.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well what does it presage?

ERIC IDLE:
You have green, scaly skin, and a soft yellow underbelly with a series of fin-like ridges running down your spine and tail. Although lizardlike in shape, you can grow anything up to thirty feet in length with huge teeth that can bite off great rocks and trees. You inhabit arid sub-tropical zones and wear spectacles.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It's very good about the spectacles.

ERIC IDLE:
It's amazing.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Mm ... what's yours, Irene?

ERIC IDLE:
Basil.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'm sorry, what's yours, Basil?

ERIC IDLE:
No. That's my star sign, Basil...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
There isn't a...

ERIC IDLE:
Yes there is ... Aquarius, Sagittarius, Derry and Toms, Basil. June 21st to June 22nd.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, what does it say?

ERIC IDLE:
You have green, scaly skin and a series of yellow underbellies running down your spine and tail ...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
That's exactly the same!

ERIC IDLE:
Try number one ... what's Aquarius?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It's a zodiacal sign.

ERIC IDLE:
I know that, what does it say in the paper Mrs Flan-and-pickle?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
All right... Oh! It says, 'a wonderful day ahead'. You will be surrounded by family and friends. Roger Moore will drop in for lunch, bringing Tony Curtis with him. In the afternoon a substantial cash sum will come your way. In the evening Petula Clark will visit your home accompanied by Mike Samrues singers. She will sing for you in your own living room. Before you go to bed, Peter Wyngarde will come and declare his undying love for you.

ERIC IDLE:
Urghh! What's Scorpio?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, that's very good. 'You will have lunch with a schoolfriend of Duane Eddy's, who will insist on whistling some of Duane's greatest instrumental hits. In the afternoon you will die, you will be buried...'
