MICHAEL PALIN:
Ugh!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah! 'Tis my lord of Buckingham. Pray welcome, Your Grace.

TERRY JONES:
Thank you, Grantley.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ladies, may I introduce to you the man who prophesied that a German monarch would soon embroil this country in continental affairs.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh, how so, my lord?

TERRY JONES:
Madam, you will recall that prior to his accession our gracious sovereign George had become involved in the long standing Northern War, through his claims to Bremen and Verdun. These duchies would provide an outlet to the sea of the utmost value to Hanover. The Treaty of Westphalia has assigned them to Sweden.

MICHAEL PALIN:
In 1648.

TERRY JONES:
Exactly.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Meanwhile Frederick William of Denmark, taking advantage of the absence of Charles XII, seized them; 1712.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
It all falls into place. More wine?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, thank you.

TERRY JONES:
However, just prior to his accession, George had made an alliance with Frederick William of Prussia, on the grounds of party feeling.

MICHAEL PALIN:
While Frederick William had married George's only daughter.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
I remember the wedding.

TERRY JONES:
But chiefly through concern at the concerted action against Charles XII...

JOHN CLEESE:
Stand and deliver.

JOHN CLEESE:
The same. And now my lords, my ladies ...your lupins, please.

TERRY JONES:
Our what?

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, come come, don't play games with me my Lord of Buckingham.

TERRY JONES:
What can you mean?

JOHN CLEESE:
Your life or your lupins, my lord.

JOHN CLEESE:
In a bunch, in a bunch.

JOHN CLEESE:
Thank you my friends, and now a good evening to you all.

MICHAEL PALIN:
He seeks them here ... he seeks them there ... he seeks those lupins everywhere. The murdering blackguard! He's taken all our lupins.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Not quite.

TERRY JONES:
Oh you tricked him!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh Mr Moore, Mr Moore, she's going fast.

JOHN CLEESE:
Don't worry, I've... I've brought you something.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Medicine at last?

JOHN CLEESE:
No.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Food?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Some blankets perhaps... clothes... wood for the fire...

JOHN CLEESE:
No. Lupins!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh Christ!

JOHN CLEESE:
I thought you liked them.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'm sick to bloody death of them.

TERRY JONES:
So am I.

MICHAEL PALIN:
She's bloody dying and all you bring us is lupins. All we've eaten mate for the last four bleeding weeks is lupin soup, roast lupin, steamed lupin, braised lupin in lupin sauce, lupin in the basket with sauted lupins, lupin meringue pie, lupin sorbet... we sit on lupins, we sleep in lupins, we feed the cat on lupins, we burn lupins, we even

MICHAEL PALIN:
the bloody things!

JOHN CLEESE:
Looks very smart.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh shut up! We're sick to death with the stench of them.

MICHAEL PALIN:
!

JOHN CLEESE:
Like what?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Like gold and silver and clothes and wood and jewels and...

JOHN CLEESE:
Hang on, I'll get a piece of paper.

TERRY JONES:
This, coupled with the presence of Peter and his Prussians at Mecklenburg and Charles and his Swedes in Pomerania, made George and Stanhope eager to come to terms with France.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Meanwhile, a breach had now opened with...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh no, not again.

TERRY JONES:
Come on.

JOHN CLEESE:
Stand and deliver again! Your money, your jewellery, your ... hang on.

JOHN CLEESE:
Your clothes, your snuff, your ornaments, your glasswear, your pussy cats...

TERRY JONES:
Don't say anything about the lupins...

JOHN CLEESE:
Your watches, your lace, your spittoons...

JOHN CLEESE:
Here we are.
