MICHAEL PALIN:
Just starting on BBC 1 now, 'Victoria Regina' the inspiring tale of the simple crofter's daughter who worked her way up to become Queen of England and Empress of the Greatest Empire television has ever seen. On BBC 2 now Episode 3 of 'George I' the new 116 part serial about the famous English King who hasn't been done yet. On ITV now the

DIRECTION:
sound of a punch

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ugh!

DIRECTION:
Music starts. Picture of Royal crest.

DIRECTION:
SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'GEORGE I'

DIRECTION:
The word 'Charles' below the crest has been crossed out and 'George I' written above it.

DIRECTION:
CAPTION: 'EPISODE 3 - THE GATHERING STORM'

DIRECTION:
This looks very dog-eared and thumb-printed. Cut to studio set of an eighteenth-century ballroom. Some dancing is going on. A fop is talking to two ladies in the usual phony mouthing manner. They laugh meaninglessly.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah! 'Tis my lord of Buckingham. Pray welcome, Your Grace.

TERRY JONES:
Thank you, Grantley.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ladies, may I introduce to you the man who prophesied that a German monarch would soon embroil this country in continental affairs.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh, how so, my lord?

TERRY JONES:
Madam, you will recall that prior to his accession our gracious sovereign George had become involved in the long standing Northern War, through his claims to Bremen and Verdun. These duchies would provide an outlet to the sea of the utmost value to Hanover. The Treaty of Westphalia has assigned them to Sweden.

MICHAEL PALIN:
In 1648.

TERRY JONES:
Exactly.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Meanwhile Frederick William of Denmark, taking advantage of the absence of Charles XII, seized them; 1712.

DIRECTION:
Oh yes!

CAROL CLEVELAND:
It all falls into place. More wine?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, thank you.

TERRY JONES:
However, just prior to his accession, George had made an alliance with Frederick William of Prussia, on the grounds of party feeling.

MICHAEL PALIN:
While Frederick William had married George's only daughter.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
I remember the wedding.

TERRY JONES:
But chiefly through concern at the concerted action against Charles XII...

DIRECTION:
There is a crash as Moore swings through the window on a rope. Everyone gasps and screams. He lands spectacularly.

JOHN CLEESE:
Stand and deliver.

DIRECTION:
Dennis Moore!

JOHN CLEESE:
The same. And now my lords, my ladies ...your lupins, please.

DIRECTION:
General bewilderment and consternation.

TERRY JONES:
Our what?

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, come come, don't play games with me my Lord of Buckingham.

TERRY JONES:
What can you mean?

DIRECTION:
putting pistol to his head

JOHN CLEESE:
Your life or your lupins, my lord.

DIRECTION:
Buckingham and the rest of the gathering now produce lupins which they have secreted about their several persons. They offer them to Moore.

JOHN CLEESE:
In a bunch, in a bunch.

DIRECTION:
they arrange them in a bunch

JOHN CLEESE:
Thank you my friends, and now a good evening to you all.

DIRECTION:
He grabs the rope, is hauled into air and disappears out of the window. There is a bump, a whinny and the sound of galloping hooves. The guests rush to the window to watch him disappear.

MICHAEL PALIN:
He seeks them here ... he seeks them there ... he seeks those lupins everywhere. The murdering blackguard! He's taken all our lupins.

DIRECTION:
produring one from her garter

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Not quite.

DIRECTION:
Gasps of delight.

TERRY JONES:
Oh you tricked him!

DIRECTION:
We still have one!

DIRECTION:
they all cheer

DIRECTION:
Cut to a similar montage as before of Moore galloping through forest, clearings and tiny villages. Song as follows.

DIRECTION:
Dennis Moore, Dennis Moore,

DIRECTION:
Riding through the night.

DIRECTION:
Soon every lupin in the land

DIRECTION:
Will be in his mighty hand

DIRECTION:
He steals them from the rich

DIRECTION:
And gives them to the poor

DIRECTION:
Mr Moore, Mr Moore, Mr Moore.

DIRECTION:
Towards the end of this he arrives at the same peasant's cottage as before, dismounts and runs to the cottage door. He pauses. From inside the cottage we hear quiet moaning. Cut to inside the cottage. In this rude hut, lit by a single candle, the female peasant lies apparently dying on a bunk. Lupins are everywhere, in the fire, on the bed, a large pile of them forms a pillow. The female peasant is moaning and the male peasant is kneeling beside her offering her a lupin. Moore enters slowly.

DIRECTION:
dressed largely in a lupin suit

DIRECTION:
Dennis Moore reverently approaches the bed; the male peasant looks round and sees him

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh Mr Moore, Mr Moore, she's going fast.

JOHN CLEESE:
Don't worry, I've... I've brought you something.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Medicine at last?

JOHN CLEESE:
No.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Food?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Some blankets perhaps... clothes... wood for the fire...

JOHN CLEESE:
No. Lupins!

DIRECTION:
exploding

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh Christ!

DIRECTION:
astonished

JOHN CLEESE:
I thought you liked them.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'm sick to bloody death of them.

TERRY JONES:
So am I.

MICHAEL PALIN:
She's bloody dying and all you bring us is lupins. All we've eaten mate for the last four bleeding weeks is lupin soup, roast lupin, steamed lupin, braised lupin in lupin sauce, lupin in the basket with sauted lupins, lupin meringue pie, lupin sorbet... we sit on lupins, we sleep in lupins, we feed the cat on lupins, we burn lupins, we even

DIRECTION:
wear

MICHAEL PALIN:
the bloody things!

JOHN CLEESE:
Looks very smart.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh shut up! We're sick to death with the stench of them.

DIRECTION:
sound of a miaow and then a bump

DIRECTION:
we see a dead cat with lupins coming out of its mouth

DIRECTION:
useful

MICHAEL PALIN:
!

JOHN CLEESE:
Like what?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Like gold and silver and clothes and wood and jewels and...

JOHN CLEESE:
Hang on, I'll get a piece of paper.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a montage of shots of Moore riding away from the hut over which we hear the song.

DIRECTION:
Dum dum dum the night.

DIRECTION:
Dum de dum dum plight.

DIRECTION:
He steals dum dum dum

DIRECTION:
And dum dum dum dee

DIRECTION:
Dennis dum, Dennis dee, dum dum dum.

DIRECTION:
Cut back to the ballroom to find the same people discussing British history.

TERRY JONES:
This, coupled with the presence of Peter and his Prussians at Mecklenburg and Charles and his Swedes in Pomerania, made George and Stanhope eager to come to terms with France.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Meanwhile, a breach had now opened with...

DIRECTION:
Moore swings in as before.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh no, not again.

TERRY JONES:
Come on.

JOHN CLEESE:
Stand and deliver again! Your money, your jewellery, your ... hang on.

DIRECTION:
he takes out a list

JOHN CLEESE:
Your clothes, your snuff, your ornaments, your glasswear, your pussy cats...

DIRECTION:
aside to the first lady

TERRY JONES:
Don't say anything about the lupins...

JOHN CLEESE:
Your watches, your lace, your spittoons...

DIRECTION:
Cut to a montage pretty much as before but with Moore riding through the glades dragging behind him a really enormous bag marked with 'swag' in very olde English lettering. This bag is about twenty feet long and bumps along the ground behind the horse with the appropriate sound effects to make it sound full of valuable jewels, gold, silver, etc. Song as follows.

DIRECTION:
Riding through the woods.

DIRECTION:
Dennis Moore, Dennis Moore

DIRECTION:
With a bag of things.

DIRECTION:
He gives to the poor and he takes from the rich

DIRECTION:
Dennis Moore, Dennis Moore, Dennis Moore.

DIRECTION:
As he arrives at the poor peasant's cottage they run out. They all open the bag together to the peasants' enormous and unmeasurable joy.

JOHN CLEESE:
Here we are.

DIRECTION:
SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'THE END'
