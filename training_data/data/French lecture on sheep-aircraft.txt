DIRECTION:
Two Frenchmen stand in front of a diagram of a sheep adapted for flying. They speak rapidly in French, much of it pseudo.

JOHN CLEESE:
Bonsoir - ici nous avons les diagrammes modernes d'un mouton anglo-français ... maintenant ... baa-aa, baa-aa... nous avons, dans la tête, le cabinc. Ici, on se trouve le petit capitaine Anglais, Monsieur Trubshawe.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Vive Brian, wherever you are.

JOHN CLEESE:
D'accord, d'accord. Maintenant, je vous présente mon collègue, le pouf célèbre, Jean-Brian Zatapathique.

DIRECTION:
Transfers his moustache to Second Frenchman

MICHAEL PALIN:
Maintenant, le mouton ... le landing ... les wheels, bon.

DIRECTION:
Opens diagram to show wheels on sheep's legs.

JOHN CLEESE:
Bon, les wheels, ici.

MICHAEL PALIN:
C'est formidable, n'est ce pas ...

DIRECTION:
unintelligibly indicates motor at rear of sheep

JOHN CLEESE:
Les voyageurs ... les bagages ... ils sont ... ici!

DIRECTION:
Triumphantly opens the rest of the diagram to reveal the whole brilliant arrangement. They run round flapping their arms and baa-ing. Cut to pepperpots in supermarket with off-screen interviewer.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh yes, we get a lot of French people round here.

TERRY JONES:
Ooh Yes.

MICHAEL PALIN:
All over yes.

DIRECTION:
And how do you get on with these French people?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh very well.

JOHN CLEESE:
So do I.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Me too.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh yes I like them. I mean, they think well don't they? I mean, be fair - Pascal.

TERRY JONES:
Blaise Pascal.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Jean-Paul Sartre.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, Voltaire.

TERRY JONES:
Ooh! - René Descartes.

DIRECTION:
René Descartes is sitting thinking. Bubbles come from his head with 'thinks'. Suddenly he looks happy. In thought bubble appears 'I THINK THEREFORE I AM'. A large hand comes into the picture with a pin and pricks the thought bubble. It deflates and disappears. After a second René disappears too.

DIRECTION:
Studio: Smart looking and confident announcer sitting at desk.

ERIC IDLE:
And now for something completely different. A man with three buttocks!

DIRECTION:
Interviewer and Arthur Frampton, in interview studio.

TERRY JONES:

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, yes, Splendid, splendid. Well...we were wondering, Mr Frampton, if you...could...see your way clear...

DIRECTION:
seeing a camera moving round behind him

TERRY JONES:
Here? What's that camera doing?

JOHN CLEESE:
Er, nothing, nothing at all, sir. We were wondering if you could see your way clear...to giving us...a quick... a quick... visual... Mr Frampton, will you take your trousers down?

DIRECTION:
slapping away a hand from off-screen

TERRY JONES:
'Ere, get off! I'm not taking me trousers down on television. Who do you think I am?

JOHN CLEESE:
Please take them down.

TERRY JONES:
No.

JOHN CLEESE:
Just a little bit.

JOHN CLEESE:
No, er ahem...

DIRECTION:
firmly

JOHN CLEESE:
Now look here Mr Frampton... It's perfectly easy for somebody just to come along here to the BBC simply claiming... that they have a bit to spare in the botty department...but the point is Mr. Frampton... our viewers need proof.

TERRY JONES:
I've been on Persian Radio...Get off! Arthur Figgis knows I've got three buttocks.

JOHN CLEESE:

TERRY JONES:
We go cycling together.

DIRECTION:
Cut to shot of two men riding tandem. The one behind (Graham) looks down, looks up and exclaims 'strewth'.
