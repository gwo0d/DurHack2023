MICHAEL PALIN:
Good evening and welcome to another edition of 'It's the Arts'. And we kick off this evening with the cinema.

JOHN CLEESE:
Good evening. One of the most prolific film directors of this age, or indeed of any age, is Sir Edward Ross, back in his native country for the first time for five years to open a season of his works at the National Film Theatre, and we are very fortunate to have him with us in this studio this evening.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Good evening.

JOHN CLEESE:
Edward... you don't mind if I call you Edward?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, not at all.

JOHN CLEESE:
Only it does worry some people - I don't know why...but they are a little sensitive so I take the precaution of asking on these occasions.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no, no that's fine.

JOHN CLEESE:
So Edward's all right. Splendid. Splendid. I'm sorry to have brought it up, only eh...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no, please. Edward it is.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well thank you very much for being so helpful...only it's more than my job's worth to...er...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Quite, yes.

JOHN CLEESE:
Makes it rather difficult to establish a rapport ... to put the other person at his ease...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Quite.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, silly little point but it does seem to matter. Still - less said the better. Uh...Ted...when you first started in...you don't mind if I call you Ted?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no, no everyone calls me Ted.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well it's shorter, isn't it.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes it is.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, and much less formal!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, Ted, Edward, anything!

JOHN CLEESE:
Splendid, splendid. Incidentally, do call me Tom, I don't want you playing around with any of this 'Thomas' nonsense! Ha ha ha ha! Now where were we? Ah yes. Eddie-baby, when you first started in the...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but I don't like being called 'Eddie-baby'.

JOHN CLEESE:
I'm sorry?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I don't like being called 'Eddie-baby'.

JOHN CLEESE:
Did I call you 'Eddie-baby'?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, you did! Now get on with it.

JOHN CLEESE:
I don't think I did call you Eddie-baby.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You did call me Eddie-baby.

JOHN CLEESE:
Did I call him Eddie-baby?

JOHN CLEESE:
I didn't really call you Eddie-baby, did I, sweetie?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Don't call me sweetie!!

JOHN CLEESE:
Can I call you sugar plum?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No!

JOHN CLEESE:
Pussy cat?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No.

JOHN CLEESE:
Angel-drawers?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No you may not! Now get on with it!

JOHN CLEESE:
Can I call you 'Frank'?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Why Frank?

JOHN CLEESE:
It's a nice name. Robin Day's got a hedgehog called Frank.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What is going on?

JOHN CLEESE:
Frannie, little Frannie, Frannie Knickers...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No. I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I'm off...

JOHN CLEESE:
Tell us about your latest film, Sir Edward.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What?

JOHN CLEESE:
Tell us about your latest film, if you'd be so very kind, Sir Edward.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
None of this 'pussy cat' nonsense?

JOHN CLEESE:
Promise.

JOHN CLEESE:
Please, Sir Edward.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
My latest film?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, Sir Edward.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well the idea, funnily enough, came from an idea I had when I first joined the industry in 1919. Of course, in those days I was only the tea boy.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh,

JOHN CLEESE:
up.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Sir Edward...Ross. Now, later in the programme we will be bringing you a unique event in the world of modern art. Pablo Picasso will be doing a special painting for us, on this programme, live, on a bicycle. But right now it's time to look at a man whose meteoric rise to fame...
