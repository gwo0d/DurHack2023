JOHN CLEESE:
Here we are again, Mr Jenkins.

DIRECTION:
Dennis leaves the bag and wheels his horse around

DIRECTION:
he rides off again purposefuly

DIRECTION:
Cut to ballroom. The walls are bare and the people are down to their undergarments. They sit around the table gnawing pieces of bread and dipping them in a watery soup. The central bowl of soup contains a lupin.

TERRY JONES:
Meanwhile Frederick William bushy engaged in defending against the three great powers the province of Silesia...

MICHAEL PALIN:
... which he had seized in the War of the Austrian succession against his word.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Yes, I remember.

DIRECTION:
... was now dependent on Pitt's subsidies.

DIRECTION:
Moore swings in through the window. They all respond to him with listless moans of disappointment.

JOHN CLEESE:
My lords, my ladies, on your feet, please.

DIRECTION:
he is ignored and therefore says commandingly

DIRECTION:
they stand up hurriedly

DIRECTION:
my

JOHN CLEESE:
point of view, it's perfectly satisfactory...

CAROL CLEVELAND:
What do you

DIRECTION:
want

CAROL CLEVELAND:
? Why are you here?

JOHN CLEESE:
Why are any of us here? I mean, when you get down to it, it's all so meaningless, isn't it? I mean what do any of us want...

TERRY JONES:
No, no, what do you want

DIRECTION:
now

TERRY JONES:
?

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh I see, oh just the usual things, a little place of my own, the right girl...

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, no, no! What do you want from

DIRECTION:
us

MICHAEL PALIN:
?

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh sorry. Your gold, your silver, your jewellery.

TERRY JONES:
You've taken it all.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
This is all we've got left.

JOHN CLEESE:
That's nice. I'll have them. Come on.

DIRECTION:
he takes all the spoons

TERRY JONES:
You'd better take the bloody lupin too.

JOHN CLEESE:
Thank you very much, I've gone through that stage.

DIRECTION:
he grabs the rope and swings out again

DIRECTION:
Short montage of Dennis riding accompanied by the song.

DIRECTION:
Dennis Moore, Dennis Moore

DIRECTION:
Etcetera, etcetera...

DIRECTION:
He leaps off his horse and runs to the door of the hut, throws the door open and enters. The little hut is now stuffed with all possible signs of wealth and all imaginable treasures.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What you got for us today then.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well I've managed to find you four very nice silver spoons Mr Jenkins.

DIRECTION:
snatching them rudely

MICHAEL PALIN:
Who do you think you are giving us poor this rubbish?

TERRY JONES:
Bloody silver. Won't have it in the house.

DIRECTION:
throws it away

TERRY JONES:
And those candlesticks you got us last week were only sixteen carat.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, why don't you go out and steal something nice like some Venetian silver.

TERRY JONES:
Or a Velasquez for the outside loo.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh all right.

DIRECTION:
turns purposefully

DIRECTION:
Usual montage of Dennis Moore riding plus song.

DIRECTION:
Dennis Moore, Dennis Moore

DIRECTION:
Riding through the land

DIRECTION:
Without a merry band

DIRECTION:
He steals from the poor and gives to the rich

DIRECTION:
Stupid bitch.

DIRECTION:
Dennis Moore reins to sudden halt and looks over to camera.

JOHN CLEESE:
What did you sing?

DIRECTION:
speaking

DIRECTION:
We sang... he steals from the poor and gives to the rich.

JOHN CLEESE:
Wait a tic ... blimey, this redistribution of wealth is trickier than I thought.
