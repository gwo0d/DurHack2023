JOHN CLEESE:
Here we are again, Mr Jenkins.

TERRY JONES:
Meanwhile Frederick William bushy engaged in defending against the three great powers the province of Silesia...

MICHAEL PALIN:
... which he had seized in the War of the Austrian succession against his word.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Yes, I remember.

JOHN CLEESE:
My lords, my ladies, on your feet, please.

JOHN CLEESE:
point of view, it's perfectly satisfactory...

CAROL CLEVELAND:
What do you

CAROL CLEVELAND:
? Why are you here?

JOHN CLEESE:
Why are any of us here? I mean, when you get down to it, it's all so meaningless, isn't it? I mean what do any of us want...

TERRY JONES:
No, no, what do you want

TERRY JONES:
?

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh I see, oh just the usual things, a little place of my own, the right girl...

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, no, no! What do you want from

MICHAEL PALIN:
?

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh sorry. Your gold, your silver, your jewellery.

TERRY JONES:
You've taken it all.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
This is all we've got left.

JOHN CLEESE:
That's nice. I'll have them. Come on.

TERRY JONES:
You'd better take the bloody lupin too.

JOHN CLEESE:
Thank you very much, I've gone through that stage.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What you got for us today then.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well I've managed to find you four very nice silver spoons Mr Jenkins.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Who do you think you are giving us poor this rubbish?

TERRY JONES:
Bloody silver. Won't have it in the house.

TERRY JONES:
And those candlesticks you got us last week were only sixteen carat.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, why don't you go out and steal something nice like some Venetian silver.

TERRY JONES:
Or a Velasquez for the outside loo.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh all right.

JOHN CLEESE:
What did you sing?

JOHN CLEESE:
Wait a tic ... blimey, this redistribution of wealth is trickier than I thought.
