DIRECTION:
Cut to shaky titles: Mr Dibley's 'Finian's Rainbow starring the man from the off-licence'. Cut to the man from the off-licence standing by a tennis-court. He wears a dress and appears to be trying to say something - he has forgotten his words. He does an unconvincing little dance.

DIRECTION:
CAPTION: 'THE END'

TERRY JONES:
Bloody terrible.
