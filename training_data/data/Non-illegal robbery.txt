ANIMATION:

DIRECTION:
leading to: A garret room with a bare table. Around it are grouped four desperate-looking robbers. The Boss has a rolled-up map. One of the gang, the fifth, is looking out of the window.

MICHAEL PALIN:
All clear?

JOHN CLEESE:
All clear, boss.

DIRECTION:
unfolding big map across table; talking carefuly

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right ... this is the plan then. At 10:45 .. you, Reg, collect me and Ken in the van, and take us round to the British Jewellery Centre in the High Street. We will arrive outside the British Jewellery Centre at 10:50 a of m. I shall then get out of the car, you Reg, take it and park it back here in Denver Street, right? At 10:51, I shall enter the British Jewellery Centre, where you, Vic, disguised as a customer, will meet me and hand me £5.18.3d. At 10:52, I shall approach the counter and purchase a watch costing £5.18.3d. I shall then give the watch to you, Vic. You'll go straight to Norman's Garage in East Street. You lads continue back up here at 10:56 and we rendezvous in the back room at the Cow and Sickle, at 11:15. All right, any questions?

TERRY JONES:
We don't seem to be doing anything illegal.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What do you mean?

TERRY JONES:
Well ... we're paying for the watch.

DIRECTION:
patiently

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes...

DIRECTION:
hesitating

DIRECTION:
paying

TERRY JONES:
for the watch?

DIRECTION:
heavily

DIRECTION:
pay

MICHAEL PALIN:
for it, would they... eh?

TERRY JONES:
Look! I don't like this outfit.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Why not?

DIRECTION:
at last feeling free to say what's on his mind

TERRY JONES:
Well, we never break the bloody law.

DIRECTION:
General consternation.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What d'you mean?

TERRY JONES:
Well, look at that bank job last week.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What was wrong with that?

TERRY JONES:
Well having to go in there with a mask on and ask for £15 out of my deposit account; that's what was wrong with it.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Listen! What are you trying to say, Larry?

TERRY JONES:
Couldn't we just steal the watch, Boss

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, you dumb cluck! We spent weeks organizing this job. Reg rented a room across the road and filmed the people going in and out every day. Vic spent three weeks looking at watch catalogues...until he knew the price of each one backwards, and now I'm not going to risk the whole raid just for the sake of breaking the law.

TERRY JONES:
Urr... couldn't we park on a double yellow line?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No!

TERRY JONES:
Couldn't we get a dog to foul the foot...

DIRECTION:
suddenly going pale

ERIC IDLE:
'Ere, Boss!

MICHAEL PALIN:
What's the matter with you?

ERIC IDLE:
I just thought... I left the car on a meter... and it's...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Overdue?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, Boss.

MICHAEL PALIN:
How much?

DIRECTION:
quaking

ERIC IDLE:
I dunno, Boss... maybe two ... maybe five minutes ...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Five minutes overdue. You fool! You fool! All right ... we've no time to lose. Ken - shave all your hair off, get your passport and meet me at this address in Rio de Janeiro Tuesday night. Vic - go to East Africa, have plastic surgery and meet me there. Reg - go to Canada and work your way south to Nicaragua by July. Larry - you stay here as front man. Give us fifteen minutes then blow the building up. All right, make it fast.

TERRY JONES:
I can't blow the building up.

TERRY JONES:
It's illegal.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh bloody hell. Well we'd better give ourselves up then.

ERIC IDLE:
We can't, Boss.

ERIC IDLE:
We haven't done anything illegal.
