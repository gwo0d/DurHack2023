MICHAEL PALIN:
What a strange turn this cycling tour has taken. Mr Gulliver appears to have lost his memory and far from being interested in safer food is now convinced that he is Clodagh Rogers, the young girl singer. I am taking him for medical attention.

DIRECTION:
Cut to Pither and Gulliver cycling into hospital. A sign says 'North Cornwall District Hospital'. Cut to nurse receptionist at a counter with a glass window which lifts up and down. Pither appears.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Is this the Casualty Department?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, that's right.

DIRECTION:
Noise of splintering wood and crash out of vision. Pither and the nurse look up. A bench has collapsed in the middle and three patients sitting on it have slid into a heap in the middle. A nurse is on her way to assist. Cut back to Pither and nurse.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
And what can I do for you?

DIRECTION:
The window comes down on her fingers, she winces sharply in pain. She pushes it up again.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I am at present on a cycling tour of the North Cornwall area taking in Bude and...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Could I have your name please?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah, my name is Pither.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What?

MICHAEL PALIN:
P-I-T-H-E-R ...as in Brotherhood, but with PI instead of the BRO and no HOOD.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I see...

MICHAEL PALIN:
I had just visited Taunton...

DIRECTION:
Terrific crash. Cut to trolley on its side, and a bandaged patient under a mound of hospital instruments and a nurse standing looking down.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Sh!

MICHAEL PALIN:
...and was cycling north towards...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, where were you injured?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Just where the A397 Ilfracombe road meets the...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
On your

body

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah no... it's not I who was injured, it's my friend.

DIRECTION:
Nurse scowls, crumples up paper, and throws it away. The piece of paper hits a smallish cabinet of glass which topples forward and smashes.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Tut... Name?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Pither.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no, no, no. Your friend's name.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, Clodagh Rogers...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Clodagh Rogers!?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well only since about 4:30....

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes. I think you'd better talk to Doctor Wu... Doctor!

DIRECTION:
Cut to a doctor unloading a crate balanced on top of a medicine. He whips round knocking off the crate.

JOHN CLEESE:
What? Damn!

DIRECTION:
Cut to patient in a wheelchair being pushed. The wheelchair completely collapses and the nurse is left holding the handles. Quick cut to the nurse as window comes down on her fingers again.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Aaaaaagh!

DIRECTION:
Doctor comes across to pither, limping slightly, in some pain.

JOHN CLEESE:
Now, what's the trouble?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I am on a cycling tour of...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
He

DIRECTION:
thinks

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
he's had an accident.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I have friend who, as a result of his injuries thinks he is Clodagh Rogers.

JOHN CLEESE:
He what?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, what happened was...

DIRECTION:
A nurse carrying a tray walks past the doctor, making for the entrance doors. As she reaches them they swing open to admit Gulliver, with his head bandaged and his arm in a sling. He collides with the nurse; she drops her tray. He graps Pither and they exit rapidly, stepping on the doctor's foot in the process. The doctor yells, grabs his foot, and as he does so the reception window slamms down, trapping his hand. He howls in pain. Cut to a camp fire at midnight in a forest clearing. By the light of the fire, Pither is writing up his diary.
