ERIC IDLE:
Now on BBC television a choice of viewing. On BBC 2 - a discussion on censorship between Derek Hart, The Bishop of Woolwich and a nude man. And on BBC 1 - me telling you this. And now...

DIRECTION:
Sound of TV set bring switched off. The picture reduces to a spot and we pull out to see that it was actually on a TV set which has just been switched off by the housewife. She and the gas man are now sitting in her living room. He is perched awkwardly on the edge of the sofa. He holds a cup of tea with a cherry on a stick in it.

TERRY JONES:
We don't want that, do we. Do you really want that cherry in your tea? Do you like doing this job?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, it's a living, isn't it?

TERRY JONES:
I mean, don't you get bored reading people's poets all day?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, you know, sometimes ... yeah. Anyway, I think I'd better be going.

DIRECTION:
As he gets up she comes quickly to his side.

DIRECTION:
seductively

TERRY JONES:
You've got a nice torch, haven't you?

DIRECTION:
looking at it rather baffled

MICHAEL PALIN:
Er, yeah, yeah, it er... it er ... it goes on and off.

DIRECTION:
He demonstrates.

DIRECTION:
drawing closer becoming breathy

TERRY JONES:
How many volts is it?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Er ... um... well, I'll have a look at the batteries.

DIRECTION:
he starts unscrewing the end

TERRY JONES:
Oh yes, yes.

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's four and a half volts.

DIRECTION:
rubbing up against him

TERRY JONES:
Mmmm. That's wonderful. Do you want another look at the poet?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, no, I must be off, really.

TERRY JONES:
I've got Thomas Hardy in the bedroom. I'd like you to look at him.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah well, I can't touch him. He's a novelist.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, he keeps mumbling all night.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh well, novelists do, you see.

DIRECTION:
dragging him onto the sofa

TERRY JONES:
Oh forget him! What's your name, deary?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Harness.

TERRY JONES:
No, no! Your first name, silly!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Wombat.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, Wombat. Wombat Harness! Take me to the place where eternity knows no bounds, where the garden of love encloses us round. Oh Harness!

MICHAEL PALIN:
All right, I'll have a quick look at yer Thomas Hardy.

DIRECTION:
Cut to studio discussion.

DIRECTION:
CAPTION: 'DEREK HART'

JOHN CLEESE:
Nude man, what did you make of that?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, don't you see, that was exactly the kind of explicit sexual reference I'm objecting to. It's titillation for the sake of it. A deliberate attempt at cheap sensationalism. I don't care what the so-called avant-garde, left-wing, intellectual namby-pambies say... It is

DIRECTION:
filth

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
!

JOHN CLEESE:
Bishop.

DIRECTION:
Cut to crook hitting desk in Devious's office.

TERRY JONES:
Okay, don't anybody move!

Titles for 'The Bishop' start and then stop abruptly.
