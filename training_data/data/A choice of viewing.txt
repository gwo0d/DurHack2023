ERIC IDLE:
Now on BBC television a choice of viewing. On BBC 2 - a discussion on censorship between Derek Hart, The Bishop of Woolwich and a nude man. And on BBC 1 - me telling you this. And now...

TERRY JONES:
We don't want that, do we. Do you really want that cherry in your tea? Do you like doing this job?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, it's a living, isn't it?

TERRY JONES:
I mean, don't you get bored reading people's poets all day?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, you know, sometimes ... yeah. Anyway, I think I'd better be going.

TERRY JONES:
You've got a nice torch, haven't you?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Er, yeah, yeah, it er... it er ... it goes on and off.

TERRY JONES:
How many volts is it?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Er ... um... well, I'll have a look at the batteries.

TERRY JONES:
Oh yes, yes.

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's four and a half volts.

TERRY JONES:
Mmmm. That's wonderful. Do you want another look at the poet?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, no, I must be off, really.

TERRY JONES:
I've got Thomas Hardy in the bedroom. I'd like you to look at him.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ah well, I can't touch him. He's a novelist.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, he keeps mumbling all night.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh well, novelists do, you see.

TERRY JONES:
Oh forget him! What's your name, deary?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Harness.

TERRY JONES:
No, no! Your first name, silly!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Wombat.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, Wombat. Wombat Harness! Take me to the place where eternity knows no bounds, where the garden of love encloses us round. Oh Harness!

MICHAEL PALIN:
All right, I'll have a quick look at yer Thomas Hardy.

JOHN CLEESE:
Nude man, what did you make of that?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, don't you see, that was exactly the kind of explicit sexual reference I'm objecting to. It's titillation for the sake of it. A deliberate attempt at cheap sensationalism. I don't care what the so-called avant-garde, left-wing, intellectual namby-pambies say... It is

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
!

JOHN CLEESE:
Bishop.

TERRY JONES:
Okay, don't anybody move!

ERIC IDLE:
The BBC would like to apologize for the constant repetition in this show.
