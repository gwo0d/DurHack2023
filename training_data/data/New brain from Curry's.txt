GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What's on the other side?

ERIC IDLE:
Nobody could be prouder than...

TERRY JONES:
Ugh!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Um, shall we go down and give blood?

TERRY JONES:
Oh, I don't want a great bat flapping round my neck.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
They don't do it like that! They take it from your arm!

TERRY JONES:
I can't give it. I caught swamp fever in the Tropics.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You've never even been to the Tropics. You've never been south of Sidcup.

TERRY JONES:
You can catch it off lampposts.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Catch what?

TERRY JONES:
I don't know, I'm all confused.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You ought to go and see a psychiatrist. You're a loony. You might even need a new brain.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, I couldn't afford a whole new brain.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, you could get one of those Curry's brains.

TERRY JONES:
How much are they?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Battery lights, dynamo lights, rear lights, brains - here we are...

TERRY JONES:
I'm still confused.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, there's a nice one here, thirteen-and-six, it's one of Curry's own brains.

TERRY JONES:
That one looks nice, what's that?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
That's a mudguard!

TERRY JONES:
It's only eight bob.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Aw, I think it's worth the extra five bob for the brain. I'll give them a ring.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, that was quick. Come in.

JOHN CLEESE:
Er, hello Mr and Mrs and Mrs Zambesi?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, that's right. Are you the man from Curry's?

JOHN CLEESE:
No, I've just come to say that he's on his way. Would you sign this please.

JOHN CLEESE:
Thank you very much.

JOHN CLEESE:
Thank you. Sorry to bother you.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Thank you.

JOHN CLEESE:
Thank you.

JOHN CLEESE:
Um, he's just coming now.

TERRY JONES:
Come in!

JOHN CLEESE:
Here he is.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Hello ... hello ...

TERRY JONES:
I'm not buying one from him, he doesn't give you confidence.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
He doesn't give me any confidence at all - he's obviously a dummy. I'll ring Curry's.

TERRY JONES:
Come in.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good morning - Mr and Mrs and Mrs Zambesi?

TERRY JONES:
Yes, that's right.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, that's right ...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes that's right.

MICHAEL PALIN:
All right, Rutherford, I'll take over.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, that's nice.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, we sell a lot of these. Right, shall we try a fitting?

TERRY JONES:
Oh, do I have to have an operation?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, madam, you just strap it on.

TERRY JONES:
Doesn't it go inside my head?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Not the Roadster, madam, no. You're thinking of the Brainette Major.

TERRY JONES:
How much is that?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Forty-four-and-six.

TERRY JONES:
Oh no, it's not worth it.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Not with the Curry's surgery we use, no, madam.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Now then. The best bet is the Bertrand Russell Super Silver. That's a real beauty - 250 quid plus hospital treatment.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oooh, that's a lot.

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's colour. Right.

MICHAEL PALIN:
One, two, three, testing, testing.

TERRY JONES:
Mince pie for me, please.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What did she say that for?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Quiet please. It's not adjusted yet.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, I am enjoying this rickshaw ride. I've been a Tory all my life, my life, my life. Good morning Mr Presley. How well you look, you look very well ... our cruising speed is 610 miles per hour ... well well well porridge ... well well well, well, hello hello dear ... hello dear!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right, one, two, three ...

TERRY JONES:
... eight, seven,

TERRY JONES:
four.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, she never knew that before.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Quiet please. Mrs Zambesi, who wrote the theory of relativity?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I know! I know.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Quiet, please!

TERRY JONES:
Einstane ... Einstone ... Einsteen ... Einston ... Einstin ... Einsten ... Einstein.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good.

TERRY JONES:
NoÃ«l Einstein.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right. That'll be 13/6d please.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
That's marvelous.

MICHAEL PALIN:
She can take it off at night, unless she wants to read, of course. And don't ask her too many questions because it will get hot. If you do have any trouble here is my card.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good Bye.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Thank you very much.

JOHN CLEESE:
He's gone now.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Shall we go down and give blood?

TERRY JONES:
Yes, please Mr Roosevelt, but try and keep the noise to a minimum.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'll go and get your coat for you.

TERRY JONES:
I'm quite warm in this stick of celery, thank you, Senator Muskie.

TERRY JONES:
Stapling machine, Mr Clarke.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
New brain.

TERRY JONES:
Stapling machine, Mrs Worral.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Are you sure that's working all right?

TERRY JONES:
Yes, thank you dear. It's marvellous. I think if we can win one or two of the early primaries, we could split the urban Republican vote wide open.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Um...here we are then.

TERRY JONES:
Well being President of the United States is something that I shall have to think about.
