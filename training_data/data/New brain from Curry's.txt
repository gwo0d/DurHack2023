GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What's on the other side?

DIRECTION:
The second Mrs Zambesi gets up and switches channels to reveal Dickie Attenborough still at it.

ERIC IDLE:
Nobody could be prouder than...

TERRY JONES:
Ugh!

DIRECTION:
she switches the set off

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Um, shall we go down and give blood?

TERRY JONES:
Oh, I don't want a great bat flapping round my neck.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
They don't do it like that! They take it from your arm!

TERRY JONES:
I can't give it. I caught swamp fever in the Tropics.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You've never even been to the Tropics. You've never been south of Sidcup.

TERRY JONES:
You can catch it off lampposts.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Catch what?

TERRY JONES:
I don't know, I'm all confused.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You ought to go and see a psychiatrist. You're a loony. You might even need a new brain.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, I couldn't afford a whole new brain.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, you could get one of those Curry's brains.

TERRY JONES:
How much are they?

DIRECTION:
picking up a catalogue

DIRECTION:
she thumbs through it

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Battery lights, dynamo lights, rear lights, brains - here we are...

TERRY JONES:
I'm still confused.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, there's a nice one here, thirteen-and-six, it's one of Curry's own brains.

DIRECTION:
CAPTION: 'OLD SKETCH WRITTEN BEFORE DECIMALISATION'

TERRY JONES:
That one looks nice, what's that?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
That's a mudguard!

TERRY JONES:
It's only eight bob.

DIRECTION:
CAPTION: '1np = 2½op'

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Aw, I think it's worth the extra five bob for the brain. I'll give them a ring.

DIRECTION:
she goes to the phone and dials one number

DIRECTION:
looks at her shoe

DIRECTION:
replaces phone

DIRECTION:
there is a knock at the door

TERRY JONES:
Oh, that was quick. Come in.

JOHN CLEESE:
Er, hello Mr and Mrs and Mrs Zambesi?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, that's right. Are you the man from Curry's?

JOHN CLEESE:
No, I've just come to say that he's on his way. Would you sign this please.

DIRECTION:
He hands a bare leg severed from the knee downwards round the door.

JOHN CLEESE:
Thank you very much.

DIRECTION:
she takes the pen from him but drops it

DIRECTION:
she picks it up and signs the leg

JOHN CLEESE:
Thank you. Sorry to bother you.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Thank you.

JOHN CLEESE:
Thank you.

DIRECTION:
The man goes. A knock at the door and he reappears.

JOHN CLEESE:
Um, he's just coming now.

DIRECTION:
Another knock at the door.

TERRY JONES:
Come in!

JOHN CLEESE:
Here he is.

DIRECTION:
The door opens and a dummy salesman is flung in, carrying a briefcase. He flops down on to the floor. The door shuts. The two pepperpots lean over and look at him for some time.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Hello ... hello ...

DIRECTION:
picking up the dummy

DIRECTION:
she throws it down

TERRY JONES:
I'm not buying one from him, he doesn't give you confidence.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
He doesn't give me any confidence at all - he's obviously a dummy. I'll ring Curry's.

DIRECTION:
she just picks up the phone without dialing this time

DIRECTION:
she puts the phone down

DIRECTION:
a knock on the door

TERRY JONES:
Come in.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good morning - Mr and Mrs and Mrs Zambesi?

TERRY JONES:
Yes, that's right.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, that's right ...

DIRECTION:
out of the side of the mouth in a man's voice

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes that's right.

DIRECTION:
to dummy

MICHAEL PALIN:
All right, Rutherford, I'll take over.

DIRECTION:
He opens a box and produces a device about the size of a small teapot with various gadgets and wires on it.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, that's nice.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, we sell a lot of these. Right, shall we try a fitting?

TERRY JONES:
Oh, do I have to have an operation?

DIRECTION:
He starts to put it on her head.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, madam, you just strap it on.

TERRY JONES:
Doesn't it go inside my head?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Not the Roadster, madam, no. You're thinking of the Brainette Major.

TERRY JONES:
How much is that?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Forty-four-and-six.

DIRECTION:
CAPTION: '44/6d = £2.22½p'

TERRY JONES:
Oh no, it's not worth it.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Not with the Curry's surgery we use, no, madam.

DIRECTION:
he gets out some tools

MICHAEL PALIN:
Now then. The best bet is the Bertrand Russell Super Silver. That's a real beauty - 250 quid plus hospital treatment.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oooh, that's a lot.

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's colour. Right.

DIRECTION:
he begins to twiddle a few knobs; lights flash on occasionally as he does this

MICHAEL PALIN:
One, two, three, testing, testing.

TERRY JONES:
Mince pie for me, please.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What did she say that for?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Quiet please. It's not adjusted yet.

DIRECTION:
he makes more adjustments

TERRY JONES:
Oh, I am enjoying this rickshaw ride. I've been a Tory all my life, my life, my life. Good morning Mr Presley. How well you look, you look very well ... our cruising speed is 610 miles per hour ... well well well porridge ... well well well, well, hello hello dear ... hello dear!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right, one, two, three ...

DIRECTION:
the salesman adjusts a switch

TERRY JONES:
... eight, seven,

DIRECTION:
he adjusts another switch

TERRY JONES:
four.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, she never knew that before.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Quiet please. Mrs Zambesi, who wrote the theory of relativity?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I know! I know.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Quiet, please!

DIRECTION:
he adjusts a tuning control

TERRY JONES:
Einstane ... Einstone ... Einsteen ... Einston ... Einstin ... Einsten ... Einstein.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good.

TERRY JONES:
Noël Einstein.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Right. That'll be 13/6d please.

DIRECTION:
paying him with invisible money

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
That's marvelous.

MICHAEL PALIN:
She can take it off at night, unless she wants to read, of course. And don't ask her too many questions because it will get hot. If you do have any trouble here is my card.

DIRECTION:
he reaches in his case and hands her the dismembered part of an arm

DIRECTION:
he picks up the dummy

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good Bye.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Thank you very much.

DIRECTION:
As soon as the door is shut, the man's head pop around.

JOHN CLEESE:
He's gone now.

DIRECTION:
He withdraws head and shuts the door.

DIRECTION:
tentatively

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Shall we go down and give blood?

DIRECTION:
with slightly glazed eyes

TERRY JONES:
Yes, please Mr Roosevelt, but try and keep the noise to a minimum.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'll go and get your coat for you.

TERRY JONES:
I'm quite warm in this stick of celery, thank you, Senator Muskie.

DIRECTION:
The pepperpots appear out of their gate and walk down the street. We follow them closely.

DIRECTION:
to neighbour

TERRY JONES:
Stapling machine, Mr Clarke.

DIRECTION:
explaining

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
New brain.

TERRY JONES:
Stapling machine, Mrs Worral.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a pepperpot with identical brain strapped on head.

DIRECTION:
Stapling machine, Mrs Zambesi.

DIRECTION:
They walk on passing a bus stop at which a penguin is standing reading a paper. One or two unexploded Scotsmen lie on the ground at various places.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Are you sure that's working all right?

TERRY JONES:
Yes, thank you dear. It's marvellous. I think if we can win one or two of the early primaries, we could split the urban Republican vote wide open.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Um...here we are then.

DIRECTION:
They go into a door marked 'Blood Donors'.

TERRY JONES:
Well being President of the United States is something that I shall have to think about.
