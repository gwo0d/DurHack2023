CAROL CLEVELAND:
Dear BBC, East Grinstead, Friday. I feel I really must write and protest about that sketch. My husband, in common with a lot of people of his age, is fifty. For how long are we to put up with these things. Yours sincerely, E. B. Debenham (Mrs).

DIRECTION:
Cut to another letter.

JOHN CLEESE:
Dear Freddy Grisewood, Bagshot, Surrey. As a prolific letter-writer, I feel I must protest about the previous letter. I am nearly sixty and am quite mad, but I do enjoy listening to the BBC Home Service. If this continues to go on unabated ...Dunkirk... dark days of the war... backs to the wall... Alvar Liddell ... Berlin air lift ... moral upheaval of Profumo case ... young hippies roaming the streets, raping, looting and killing. Yours etc., Brigadier Arthur Gormanstrop (Mrs).

DIRECTION:
Cut to vox pops film.

ERIC IDLE:
Well I think they should attack things, like that - with satire. I mean Ned Sherrin. Fair's fair. I think people should be able to make up their own minds for me.

TERRY JONES:
Well I think they should attack the fuddy-duddy attitudes of the lower middle classes which permit the establishment to survive and keep the mores of the whole country back where they were in the nineteenth century and the ghastly days of the pre-sexual revolution.

DIRECTION:
A boxer (Eric) runs up and knocks her out.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well that's, er, very interesting, because, er, I am, in fact, made entirely of wood.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well I think they should attack the lower classes, er, first with bombs, and rockets destroying their homes, and then when they run helpless into the streets, er, mowing them down with machine guns. Er, and then of course releasing the vultures. I know these views aren't popular, but I have never courted popularity.

DIRECTION:
A boy scout on his knees. Next to him is a scout master, seen only from the knees down.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I think there should be more race prejudice.

DIRECTION:
He is nudged.

DIRECTION:
Less.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Less race prejudice.
