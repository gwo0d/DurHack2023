TERRY JONES:
It's just that everywhere I go it's the same old thing. All anyone wants me to say is 'To be or not to be ...'

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
'... that is the question. Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous ...'

TERRY JONES:
Yes, it's either that, or 'Oh that this too solid flesh would melt ...'

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
'... would melt, thaw and resolve itself into a dew. Or that the everlasting had not fixed his canon 'gainst self slaughter ...'

TERRY JONES:
Yes. All that sort of thing. And I'm just getting really fed up.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Now do the bit about 'Alas poor Yorick ...'

TERRY JONES:
No. I'm sick of it! I want to do something else. I want to

TERRY JONES:
something of my life.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No. I don't know that bit.

TERRY JONES:
I want to get away from all that. Be different.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well um ... what do you want to be?

TERRY JONES:
A private dick!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
A private dick?

TERRY JONES:
Yes, a private dick!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Why do you want to be a private dick?

TERRY JONES:
Ooh ... why does anyone want to be a private dick? Fame, money, glamour, excitement, sex!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ah! It's the sex, is it?

TERRY JONES:
Well, that's one of the things, yes.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, what's the sex problem?

TERRY JONES:
Well, there's no problem.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Now, come on, come on. You've got the girl on the bed and she's all ready for it.

TERRY JONES:
No, no, it's nothing to do with that.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Now come on, come on, there she is, she's all ready for it. She's a real stunner, she's got great big tits, she's really well stacked and you've got her legs up against the mantelpiece.

ERIC IDLE:
All right, Mr Butler, I'll take over.

ERIC IDLE:
Morning, Mr Hamlet. My name's Natal. Sorry to keep you waiting. Now what seems to be the problem?

TERRY JONES:
Well, I was telling the other psychiatrist ...

ERIC IDLE:
He's ... he's not a psychiatrist.

TERRY JONES:
Oh. He said he was a psychiatrist.

ERIC IDLE:
Well ... yes ... um, he's a kind of psychiatrist he's ... he's not a proper psychiatrist. He's not er ... fully qualified ... in, um, quite the sort of way we should want. Anyway the problem I believe is basically sexual is it?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I asked him that!

ERIC IDLE:
Get out!

ERIC IDLE:
Now then, you've got the girl on the bed. You've been having a bit of a feel up during the evening. You've got your tongue down her throat. She's got both her legs up on the mantelpiece ...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Dr Natal ... out please!

ERIC IDLE:
I'm talking to a patient! Oh ...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Out please! I'm terribly sorry, sir. We have a lot of problems here with bogus psychiatrists. One of the risks in psychiatry I'm afraid. Unfortunately they do tend to frighten the patient and they can cause real and permanent damage to the treatment. But I assure you that I am a completely bona fide psychiatrist. Here's my diploma in psychiatry from the University of Oxford. This here shows that I'm a member of the British Psychiatric Association, a very important body indeed. Here's a letter from another psychiatrist in which he mentions that I'm a psychiatrist. This is my Psychiatric Club tie, and as you can see the cufflinks match. I've got a copy of 'Psychiatry Today' in my bag, which I think is pretty convincing. And a letter here from my mother in which she asks how the psychiatry is going, and I think you'll realize that the one person you can't fool is your mother. So if you'd like to ask me any questions about psychiatry, I bet I can answer them.

TERRY JONES:
No, no, it's all right, really.

MICHAEL PALIN:
OK, you've got this girl on your bed, you've had a few drinks, you've got her stretched out and her feet on the mantelpiece ...

MICHAEL PALIN:
yes, what is it?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
There's a proper psychiatrist to see you, Dr Rufus Berg.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, oh my God! Ok, thank you.

TERRY GILLIAM:
Right you've got the girl down on the bed, you've got her legs up on the mantelpiece.

ERIC IDLE:
Well, well done, Mr Hamlet. You've done extremely well in our disorientation tests.

TERRY JONES:
Oh? Oh!

ERIC IDLE:
You see, I'm sorry it might have confused you a little, but we do this to try to establish a very good doctor/patient relationship, you see ... we do it to sort of, as it were, to break down the barriers. All right?

TERRY JONES:
Yes fine.

ERIC IDLE:
Good! Well, you've got her legs up on the mantelpiece ...

TERRY JONES:
On behalf of the Psychiatric Association, I should like to say that we are taking firm action to clamp down on the activities of bogus psychiatrists. In fact in many areas of modern psychiatry computers are now being increasingly used for the first basic diagnosis and this has gone a long way in eliminating the danger of unqualified impostors.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Out!
