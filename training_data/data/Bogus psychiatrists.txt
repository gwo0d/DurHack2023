DIRECTION:
Quick cut to a close shot of a big American car skidding round a corner. Music. Montage of close ups of tires, foot on accelerator shots, etc. with a deafening sound track. The car skids to a halt at the side of the curb. Pull out to reveal it is in a smart Harley Street type location. The door opens and out gets a man in black leotard, with make-up and a small crown - Hamlet, in fact. He goes into a doorway, presses the doorbell and waits. Cut to modern psychiatrist's office. Hamlet is lying on the couch.

TERRY JONES:
It's just that everywhere I go it's the same old thing. All anyone wants me to say is 'To be or not to be ...'

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
'... that is the question. Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous ...'

DIRECTION:
quickly

TERRY JONES:
Yes, it's either that, or 'Oh that this too solid flesh would melt ...'

DIRECTION:
taking over

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
'... would melt, thaw and resolve itself into a dew. Or that the everlasting had not fixed his canon 'gainst self slaughter ...'

TERRY JONES:
Yes. All that sort of thing. And I'm just getting really fed up.

DIRECTION:
picking up a skull

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Now do the bit about 'Alas poor Yorick ...'

TERRY JONES:
No. I'm sick of it! I want to do something else. I want to

DIRECTION:
make

TERRY JONES:
something of my life.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No. I don't know that bit.

TERRY JONES:
I want to get away from all that. Be different.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well um ... what do you want to be?

TERRY JONES:
A private dick!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
A private dick?

TERRY JONES:
Yes, a private dick!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Why do you want to be a private dick?

TERRY JONES:
Ooh ... why does anyone want to be a private dick? Fame, money, glamour, excitement, sex!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ah! It's the sex, is it?

TERRY JONES:
Well, that's one of the things, yes.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, what's the sex problem?

TERRY JONES:
Well, there's no problem.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Now, come on, come on. You've got the girl on the bed and she's all ready for it.

TERRY JONES:
No, no, it's nothing to do with that.

DIRECTION:
getting excited

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Now come on, come on, there she is, she's all ready for it. She's a real stunner, she's got great big tits, she's really well stacked and you've got her legs up against the mantelpiece.

ERIC IDLE:
All right, Mr Butler, I'll take over.

DIRECTION:
a distinguished-looking man in a suit enters; the psychiatrist leaves

ERIC IDLE:
Morning, Mr Hamlet. My name's Natal. Sorry to keep you waiting. Now what seems to be the problem?

TERRY JONES:
Well, I was telling the other psychiatrist ...

ERIC IDLE:
He's ... he's not a psychiatrist.

TERRY JONES:
Oh. He said he was a psychiatrist.

ERIC IDLE:
Well ... yes ... um, he's a kind of psychiatrist he's ... he's not a proper psychiatrist. He's not er ... fully qualified ... in, um, quite the sort of way we should want. Anyway the problem I believe is basically sexual is it?

DIRECTION:
The psychiatrist puts his head round door.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I asked him that!

ERIC IDLE:
Get out!

DIRECTION:
the psychiatrist goes; to Hamlet

ERIC IDLE:
Now then, you've got the girl on the bed. You've been having a bit of a feel up during the evening. You've got your tongue down her throat. She's got both her legs up on the mantelpiece ...

DIRECTION:
Enter a distinguished-looking psychiatrist in a white coat.

DIRECTION:
Michael, quietly and authoritatively, indicating the door

MICHAEL PALIN:
Dr Natal ... out please!

ERIC IDLE:
I'm talking to a patient! Oh ...

DIRECTION:
he goes

MICHAEL PALIN:
Out please! I'm terribly sorry, sir. We have a lot of problems here with bogus psychiatrists. One of the risks in psychiatry I'm afraid. Unfortunately they do tend to frighten the patient and they can cause real and permanent damage to the treatment. But I assure you that I am a completely bona fide psychiatrist. Here's my diploma in psychiatry from the University of Oxford. This here shows that I'm a member of the British Psychiatric Association, a very important body indeed. Here's a letter from another psychiatrist in which he mentions that I'm a psychiatrist. This is my Psychiatric Club tie, and as you can see the cufflinks match. I've got a copy of 'Psychiatry Today' in my bag, which I think is pretty convincing. And a letter here from my mother in which she asks how the psychiatry is going, and I think you'll realize that the one person you can't fool is your mother. So if you'd like to ask me any questions about psychiatry, I bet I can answer them.

TERRY JONES:
No, no, it's all right, really.

MICHAEL PALIN:
OK, you've got this girl on your bed, you've had a few drinks, you've got her stretched out and her feet on the mantelpiece ...

DIRECTION:
the intercom buzzes

MICHAEL PALIN:
yes, what is it?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
There's a proper psychiatrist to see you, Dr Rufus Berg.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, oh my God! Ok, thank you.

DIRECTION:
he hurriedly changes into a police constable's uniform

DIRECTION:
exits hurriedly

DIRECTION:
A fourth psychiatrist rushes in.

TERRY GILLIAM:
Right you've got the girl down on the bed, you've got her legs up on the mantelpiece.

DIRECTION:
Two men in white coats bundle him out. Dr Natal Enters.

ERIC IDLE:
Well, well done, Mr Hamlet. You've done extremely well in our disorientation tests.

TERRY JONES:
Oh? Oh!

ERIC IDLE:
You see, I'm sorry it might have confused you a little, but we do this to try to establish a very good doctor/patient relationship, you see ... we do it to sort of, as it were, to break down the barriers. All right?

TERRY JONES:
Yes fine.

ERIC IDLE:
Good! Well, you've got her legs up on the mantelpiece ...

DIRECTION:
The two men come in and chase him out. Cut to a man at a consultant's desk in a smart West End surgery.

DIRECTION:
CAPTION: 'DR BRUCE GENUINE, CHAIRMAN OF THE PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION'

TERRY JONES:
On behalf of the Psychiatric Association, I should like to say that we are taking firm action to clamp down on the activities of bogus psychiatrists. In fact in many areas of modern psychiatry computers are now being increasingly used for the first basic diagnosis and this has gone a long way in eliminating the danger of unqualified impostors.

DIRECTION:
Cut to Hamlet in an office. A big, impressive-looking computer beside him.

DIRECTION:
in tinny computer voice

DIRECTION:
You've had your tongue down her throat and she's got her legs on the mantelpiece.

DIRECTION:
The door opens and a nurse appears.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Out!

DIRECTION:
The computer scuttles for the door, revealing that underneath it are six pairs of legs, in pin-striped trousers and expensive shoes. Cut to the same computer in a field. The nurse picks up a bazooka. The computer rises into the air, the nurse fires at it and it explodes.

DIRECTION:
'Nationwide' type music and credits. Michael Charlton in a studio.
