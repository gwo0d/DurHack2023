JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, tonight 'Probe Around' takes a look at crime...

ERIC IDLE:
I'm sorry about that, but I always introduce this programme, not him.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, tonight 'Probe Around' takes a look at Crime. Is it true that the police are using dachshunds to combat the crime wave? And can the head of the Vice Squad turn himself into an albatross whenever he wants to? Just what are the police up to?

TERRY JONES:
Oh, I'm up to page 39, where Peter Pan first manifests himself.

ERIC IDLE:
With me now is Inspector Harry H 'Snapper' Organs of 'H' Division.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good evening.

ERIC IDLE:
Er, Inspector, I believe you are encouraging magic in the Police Force?

MICHAEL PALIN:
That is correct.

MICHAEL PALIN:
The criminal mind is a strange and contorted one. Good evening. The mind is subject to severe mental stresses. Good evening. Guilt fears abound, good evening. In the subconscious in this state, one of our lads, with a fair training in the black arts can scare the fertilizer out of them.

ERIC IDLE:
Just how are the police combating the increase with the use of the occult? Ex-King Zog of Albania reports ...

ERIC IDLE:
Well we seem to have lost ex-King Zog there, but who cares. Just what kinds of magic are the police introducing into their crime prevention techniques?

JOHN CLEESE:
Up yours? What a rude Ouija board!
