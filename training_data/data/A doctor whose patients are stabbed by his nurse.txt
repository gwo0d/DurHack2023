GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, Mr Cotton, you have what we in the medical profession call a naughty complaint. My advice to you is to put this paper bag over your head - it has little holes there for your eyes, you see - and to ring this bell, and to take this card along to your hospital.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Hmm.,. hmm ... Hippocratic oath ... it's not in there ... jolly good. Very useful. Next!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ah, yes you must be Mr Williams.

TERRY JONES:
Y... yes...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well, do take a seat. What seems to be the trouble?

TERRY JONES:
I've... I've just been stabbed by your nurse...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh dear.... well I'd probably better have a look at you then. Could you fill in this form first?

TERRY JONES:
She just stabbed me...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes. She's an unpredictable sort. Look, you seem to be bleeding rather badly. I think you'd better hurry up and fill in that form.

TERRY JONES:
Ahhh ... couldn't ... I ... do ... it ... later, doctor!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no. You'd have bled to death by then. Can you hold a pen?

TERRY JONES:
I'll try.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, it's a hell of a nuisance all this damn paperwork, really it is...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
it's a real nightmare, this damned paperwork. It really is a hell of a nuisance. Something ought to be done about it.

TERRY JONES:
Do I have to answer all the questions, doctor?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, no, no, just fill in as many as you can - no need to go into too much detail. I don't know why we bother with it all, really, it's such a nuisance. Well let's see how you've done, then...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh dear oh dear... that's not very good, is it. Look, surely you knew number four!

TERRY JONES:
No ... I didn't...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
It's from 'The Merchant of Venice' - even I know that!

TERRY JONES:
It's going on the carpet, doctor.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh don't worry about that! Look at this - number six - the Treaty of Versailles, Didn't you know that? Oh, my God.

TERRY JONES:
Ahgg... aghhh.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
And number nine - Emerson Fittipaldi!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Virginia Wade? You must be mad!

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh doctor, I've just shot another patient. I don't think there's any point in your seeing him.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You didn't

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
him, did you?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
'Fraid so.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You mustn't

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
them, nurse.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh, I'm sorry doctor. It was just on the spur of the moment. Rather silly really.

TERRY JONES:
I'm sorry about the carpet, doctor.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Mr Williams, I'm afraid I can't give you any marks, so I won't be able to recommend you for hospital. Tell you what - I'll stop the bleeding - but strictly speaking I shouldn't even do that on marks like these...

CAROL CLEVELAND:
There are no more patients now, doctor.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh well, let's go and have lunch, then.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
What about... er...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ah yes - look, Mr Williams we're just popping out for a bite of lunch while we've got a spare moment, you know. Look, have another bash at the form... and if at least you can answer the question on history right, then we may be able to give you some morphine or something like that, OK?

TERRY JONES:
Thank you, doctor, thank you.
