Cut to an as overgrown, jungleoid location as Torquay can provide. A very big thick tree in the foreground. David Attenborough pushes through jungle towards camera. He has damp sweat patches under his arms which grow perceptibly during the scene. He has two African guides in the background both with saxophones round their neck.
