ERIC IDLE:
Horace Walpole's 'Rogue Cheddar',

ERIC IDLE:
one of the first of the Cheese Westerns to be later followed by 'Gunfight at Gruy√®re Corral', 'Ilchester 73', and 'The Cheese Who Shot Liberty Valence'. While I'm on the subject of Westerns, I want to take a closer look at one of my favourite film directors, Sam Peckinpah, the expatriate from Fresno, California.

ERIC IDLE:
In his earliest films, 'Major Dundee',

ERIC IDLE:
'The Wild Bunch' and 'Straw Dogs' he showed his predilection for the utterly truthful and very sexually arousing portrayal of violence

ERIC IDLE:
In his latest film Peckinpah has moved into the calmer and more lyrical waters of Julian Slade's, 'Salad Days'.
