RITA DAVIES:
Yes, sir?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I'd like to have an argument please.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, this is my first time.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, what would be the cost?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, I think it's probably best if I start with the one and see how it goes from there. OK?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Thank you.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What do you want?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well I was told outside ...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Don't give me that you snotty-faced heap of parrot droppings!

MICHAEL PALIN:
What!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Shut your festering gob you tit! Your type makes me puke! You vacuous toffee-nosed malodorous pervert!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Look! I came here for an argument.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh! I'm sorry, this is abuse.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh I see, that explains it.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, you want room 12A next door.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I see - sorry.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Not at all.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Stupid git.

JOHN CLEESE:
Come in.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Is this the right room for an argument?

JOHN CLEESE:
I've told you once.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No you haven't.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes I have.

MICHAEL PALIN:
When?

JOHN CLEESE:
Just now!

MICHAEL PALIN:
No you didn't.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes I did!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Didn't.

JOHN CLEESE:
Did.

JOHN CLEESE:
I'm telling you I did!

MICHAEL PALIN:
You did not!

JOHN CLEESE:
I'm sorry, is this a five minute argument, or the full half hour?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh ... Just a five-minute one.

JOHN CLEESE:
Fine

JOHN CLEESE:
thank you. Anyway, I did.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You most certainly did not.

JOHN CLEESE:
Now, let's get one thing quite clear. I most definitely told you!

MICHAEL PALIN:
You did not.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes I did.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes I did!!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Look, this isn't an argument.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes it is.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No it isn't, it's just contradiction.

JOHN CLEESE:
No it isn't.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes it is.

JOHN CLEESE:
It is not.

MICHAEL PALIN:
It is. You just contradicted me.

JOHN CLEESE:
No I didn't.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ooh, you did!

JOHN CLEESE:
No, no, no, no, no.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You did, just then.

JOHN CLEESE:
No, nonsense!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, look this is futile.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I came here for a good argument.

JOHN CLEESE:
No you didn't, you came here for an argument.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, an argument's not the same as contradiction.

JOHN CLEESE:
It can be.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No it can't. An argument is a connected series of statements to establish a definite proposition.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes it is. It isn't just contradiction.

JOHN CLEESE:
Look, if I argue with you, I must take up a contrary position.

MICHAEL PALIN:
But it isn't just saying 'No it isn't'.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No it isn't, Argument is an intellectual process ... contradiction is just the automatic gainsaying of anything the other person says.

JOHN CLEESE:
Not at all.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Now look!

JOHN CLEESE:
That's it. Good morning.

MICHAEL PALIN:
But I was just getting interested.

JOHN CLEESE:
Sorry the five minutes is up.

MICHAEL PALIN:
That was never five minutes just now!

JOHN CLEESE:
I'm afraid it was.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No it wasn't.

JOHN CLEESE:
I'm sorry, I'm not allowed to argue any more.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What!?

JOHN CLEESE:
If you want me to go on arguing you'll have to pay for another five minutes.

MICHAEL PALIN:
But that was never five minutes just now ... oh Come on!

MICHAEL PALIN:
This is ridiculous.

JOHN CLEESE:
I'm very sorry, but I told you I'm not allowed to argue unless you've paid.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh. all right.

MICHAEL PALIN:
There you are.

JOHN CLEESE:
Thank you.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well?.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well what?

MICHAEL PALIN:
That was never five minutes just now.

JOHN CLEESE:
I told you I'm not allowed to argue unless you've paid!

MICHAEL PALIN:
I've just paid.

JOHN CLEESE:
No you didn't.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I did! I did! I did!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Look I don't want to argue about that.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well I'm very sorry but you didn't pay.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Aha! Well if I didn't pay, why are you arguing ... got you!

JOHN CLEESE:
No you haven't.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes I have ... if you're arguing I must have paid.

JOHN CLEESE:
Not necessarily. I could be arguing in my spare time.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I've had enough of this.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh shut up!

MICHAEL PALIN:
I want to complain.

ERIC IDLE:
You want to complain ... look at these shoes ... I've only had them three weeks and the heels are worn right through.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, I want to complain about ...

ERIC IDLE:
If you complain nothing happens ... you might just as well not bother. My back hurts and ...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ooh!

TERRY JONES:
No, no, no, hold your head like this, and then go 'waaagh'! Try it again.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Waaghh!

TERRY JONES:
Better. Better. But 'waaaaaghh'! 'Waaaagh'! Hold your hands here ...

MICHAEL PALIN:
No!

TERRY JONES:
Now.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Waagh!

TERRY JONES:
That's it. That's it. Good.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Stop hitting me!

TERRY JONES:
What?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Stop hitting me.

TERRY JONES:
Stop hitting you?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes.

TERRY JONES:
What did you come in here for then?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I came here to complain.

TERRY JONES:
Oh I'm sorry, that's next door. It's being hit on the head lessons in here.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What a stupid concept.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Right. Hold it there.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Inspector Fox of the Light Entertainment Police, Comedy Division, Special Flying Squad.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Shut up!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Ooooh?

TERRY JONES:
No, no, no - Waagh!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
And you.

TERRY JONES:
Waagh!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
He's good! You could learn a thing or two from him. Right now you two me old beauties, you are nicked.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What for?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'm charging you under Section 21 of the Strange Sketch Act.

MICHAEL PALIN:
The what?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
You are hereby charged that you did wilfully take part in a strange sketch, that is, a skit, spoof or humorous vignette of an unconventional nature with intent to cause grievous mental confusion to the Great British Public.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Evening all.

TERRY JONES:
It's a fair cop.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
And you tosh.

MICHAEL PALIN:
WAAAGH!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
That's excellent! Right, come on down the Yard.

ERIC IDLE:
Hold it. Hold it. Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Inspector Thompson's Gazelle of the Programme Planning Police, Light Entertainment Division, Special Flying Squad.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Flying Thompson's Gazelle of the Yard!

ERIC IDLE:
Shut up!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Waaaagh!

TERRY JONES:
He's good.

TERRY JONES:
WAAGH!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Rotten.

ERIC IDLE:
Good. Now I'm arrestin' this entire show on three counts: one, acts of self-conscious behaviour contrary to the 'Not in front of the children' Act, two, always saying 'It's so and so of the Yard' every time the fuzz arrives and, three, and this is the cruncher, offenses against the 'Getting out of sketches without using a proper punchline' Act, four, namely, simply ending every bleedin' sketch by just having a policeman come in and... wait a minute.

JOHN CLEESE:
Hold it.

ERIC IDLE:
It's a fair cop.
