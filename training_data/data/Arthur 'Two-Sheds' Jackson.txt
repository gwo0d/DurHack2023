ERIC IDLE:
Last week the Royal Festival Hall saw the first performance of a new symphony by one of the world's leading modern composers, Arthur 'Two Sheds' Jackson. Mr Jackson.

TERRY JONES:
Good evening.

ERIC IDLE:
May I just sidetrack for one moment. Mr. Jackson, this, what shall I call it, nickname of yours.

TERRY JONES:
Ah yes.

ERIC IDLE:
'Two sheds'. How did you come by it?

TERRY JONES:
Well, I don't use it myself, it's just a few of my friends call me 'Two Sheds'.

ERIC IDLE:
I see, and do you in fact have two sheds?

TERRY JONES:
No. No, I've only one shed. I've had one for some time, but a few years ago I said I was thinking of getting another one, and since then some people have called me 'Two Sheds'.

ERIC IDLE:
In spite of the fact that you only have one.

TERRY JONES:
Yes.

ERIC IDLE:
I see, and are you thinking of purchasing a second shed?

TERRY JONES:
No!

ERIC IDLE:
To bring you in line with your epithet?

TERRY JONES:
No.

ERIC IDLE:
I see, I see. Well let's return to your symphony. Ah, now then, did you write this symphony...

ERIC IDLE:
the shed?

ERIC IDLE:
Have you written any of your recent works in this shed of yours?

TERRY JONES:
No it's just a perfectly ordinary garden shed.

ERIC IDLE:
I see. And you're thinking of buying this second shed to write in.

TERRY JONES:
No, no. Look. This shed business, it doesn't really matter at all, the sheds aren't important. It's just a few friends call me Two Sheds and that's all there is to it. I wish you'd ask me about my music. I'm a composer. People always ask me about the sheds, they've got it out of proportion, I'm fed up with the shed, I wish I'd never got it in the first place.

ERIC IDLE:
I expect you are probably thinking of selling one.

TERRY JONES:
I will sell one.

ERIC IDLE:
Then you'll be Arthur 'No Sheds' Jackson?

TERRY JONES:
Look, forget about the sheds. They don't matter.

ERIC IDLE:
Mr. Jackson, I think, with respect, we ought to talk about your symphony.

TERRY JONES:
What?

ERIC IDLE:
Apparently your symphony was written for organ and tympani.

TERRY JONES:
What's that?

ERIC IDLE:
What's what?

TERRY JONES:
It's a shed. Get it off.

TERRY JONES:
Right.

ERIC IDLE:
Now then Mr. Jackson...your symphony.

ERIC IDLE:
I understand that you used to be interested in train-spotting.

ERIC IDLE:
I understand that, about thirty years ago, you were extremely interested in train-spotting.

TERRY JONES:
What's that got to do with my bloody music?

JOHN CLEESE:
Are you having any trouble from him?

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, a little.

JOHN CLEESE:
Exactly. Well we interviewers are more than a match for the likes of you, 'Two Sheds'.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, make yourself scarce, 'Two Sheds'. This studio isn't big enough for the three of us!

TERRY JONES:
What are you doing?

JOHN CLEESE:
Get your own Arts programme, you fairy!

ERIC IDLE:
Arthur 'Two Sheds' Jackson.

ERIC IDLE:
Never mind, Timmy.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, Michael, you are such a comfort.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Arthur 'Two Sheds'...

JOHN CLEESE:
...Jackson.
