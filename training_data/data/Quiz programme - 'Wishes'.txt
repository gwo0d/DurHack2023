JOHN CLEESE:
What's your name?

ERIC IDLE:
Eric.

JOHN CLEESE:
Would you like to have a sixteen-ton weight dropped on top of you, Eric?

ERIC IDLE:
Don't know.

JOHN CLEESE:
How about you?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I want to have.

JOHN CLEESE:
What do you want to have?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I want to have... I want to have Racquel Welch dropped on top of me.

JOHN CLEESE:
Dropped on top of you.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh yes, not climbing.

ERIC IDLE:
She's got a big bottom.

JOHN CLEESE:
And what's your name?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Trevor Atkinson.

JOHN CLEESE:
And how old are you, Trevor?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'm forty-two.

JOHN CLEESE:
Are you a friend of Trevor's?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, we're all colleagues from the Empire and General Insurance Company.

JOHN CLEESE:
And what do you do?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well I deal mainly with mortgage protection policies, but I also do certain types of life assurance.

JOHN CLEESE:
Now if you and your pal had one big wish, Trevor, what would you like to see on television?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I'd like to see more fairy stories about the police.

ERIC IDLE:
And so you shall.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, we in Special Crime Squad have been using wands for almost a year now. You find it's easy to make yourself invisible. You can defy time and space, and you can turn violent criminals into frogs. Something which you could never do with the old truncheons.
