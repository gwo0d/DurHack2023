TERRY JONES:
Good afternoon.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Afternoon.

TERRY JONES:
A lovely day isn't it.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Eh, 'tis that.

TERRY JONES:
You here on holiday or...?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Nope, I live 'ere.

TERRY JONES:
Oh, jolly good too.

TERRY JONES:
sheep aren't they?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ar.

TERRY JONES:
Yes, yes of course, I thought so...only...er why are they up in the trees?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
A fair question and one that in recent weeks has been much on my mind. It's my considered opinion that they're nesting.

TERRY JONES:
Nesting?

TERRY JONES:
Like birds?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ar. Exactly. Birds is the key to the whole problem. It's my belief that these sheep are laborin' under the misapprehension that they're birds. Observe their behavior. Take for a start the sheeps' tendency to 'op about the field on their back legs.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Talk about the blind leading the blind.

TERRY JONES:
But why do they think they're birds?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Another fair question. One thing is for sure; a sheep is not a creature of the air. They have enormous difficulty in the comparatively simple act of perchin'.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
As you see. As for flight, its body is totally unadapted to the problems of aviation. Trouble is, sheep are very dim. Once they get an idea in their heads, there's no shifting it.

TERRY JONES:
But where did they get the idea from?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
From Harold. He's that sheep there over under the elm. He's that most dangerous of animals, a clever sheep. He's the ring-leader. He has realized that a sheep's life consists of standing around for a few months and then being eaten. And that's a depressing prospect for an ambitious sheep. He's patently hit on the idea of escape.

TERRY JONES:
Well why don't you just get rid of Harold?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Because of the enormous commercial possibilities should he succeed.
