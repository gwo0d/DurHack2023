Clocks start ticking and chiming in the case. The man desperately thumps the case.

MICHAEL PALIN:
All right, I confess, I'm a smuggler ... This whole case is crammed full of Swiss watches and clocks. I've been purposely trying to deceive Her Majesty's Customs and Excise. I've been a bloody fool.

JOHN CLEESE:
I don't believe you, sir.

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's true. I'm, er, guilty of smuggling.

JOHN CLEESE:
Don't give me that, sir ... you couldn't smuggle a piece of greaseproof paper let alone a case full of watches.
