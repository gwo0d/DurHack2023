ERIC IDLE:
Call Alexander Yahlt

TERRY JONES:
Oh, shut up.

ERIC IDLE:
You are Alexander Yahlt?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh I am.

ERIC IDLE:
Skip the impersonations. You are Alexander Yahlt?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I am.

ERIC IDLE:
You are hereby charged that on the 28th day of May 1970, you did wilfully, unlawfully, and with malice aforethought publish an alleged English-Hungarian phrasebook with intent to cause a breach of the peace. How do you plead?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Not guilty.

ERIC IDLE:
You live at 46, Horton Terrace?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I do live at 46, Horton Terrace.

ERIC IDLE:
You are the director of a publishing company?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I am the director of a publishing company.

ERIC IDLE:
Your company publishes phrasebooks?

MICHAEL PALIN:
My company does publish phrasebooks.

ERIC IDLE:
You did say 46, Horton Terrace, didn't you?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes.

ERIC IDLE:
Ha, ha, ha, I got him.

TERRY JONES:
Get on with it! Get on with it!

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, m'lud, on the 28th of May, you published this phrasebook.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I did.

ERIC IDLE:
I quote an example. The Hungarian phrase meaning 'Can you direct me to the station?' is translated by the English phrase, 'Please fondle my bum'.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I wish to plead incompetence.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Please may I ask for an adjournment, m'lud?

TERRY JONES:
An adjournment? Certainly not.

TERRY JONES:
Why on earth didn't you say why you wanted an adjourment?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I didn't know an acceptable legal phrase, m'lud.

TERRY JONES:
If there's any more stock film of women applauding, I'll clear the court.

ERIC IDLE:
Call Abigail Tesler

JOHN CLEESE:
M'lud - this is Abigail Tesler.

TERRY JONES:
Is it?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, m'lud. Twenty-three-year-old Abigail hails from down under, where they're upside down about her. Those Aussies certainly know a thing or two when it comes to beach belles. Bet some life-saver wouldn't mind giving her the kiss of life. So watch out for sharks, Abigail!

MICHAEL PALIN:
All will be revealed soon m'lud, quipped tall forty-two-year-old Nelson Bedowes. Cutie QC Nelson's keen on negligence and grievous bodily harm at Gray's Inn. And with cases like he's won we bet Gray's in when Nelson's around.

ERIC IDLE:
Well get on with it, admitted seventy-eight-year-old genial jurisprude Maltravers seen here at London airport, on his way to judge for Britain at the famous International Court in the Hague ...
