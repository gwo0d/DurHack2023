Derek Nimmo's voice (dubbed on)

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh I am.

ERIC IDLE:
Skip the impersonations. You are Alexander Yahlt?

DIRECTION:
normal voice

MICHAEL PALIN:
I am.

ERIC IDLE:
You are hereby charged that on the 28th day of May 1970, you did wilfully, unlawfully, and with malice aforethought publish an alleged English-Hungarian phrasebook with intent to cause a breach of the peace. How do you plead?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Not guilty.

ERIC IDLE:
You live at 46, Horton Terrace?

MICHAEL PALIN:
I do live at 46, Horton Terrace.

You are the director of a publishing company?

I am the director of a publishing company.

Your company publishes phrasebooks?

My company does publish phrasebooks.

ERIC IDLE:
You did say 46, Horton Terrace, didn't you?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes.

DIRECTION:
He claps his hand to his mouth; gong sounds - general applause.

ERIC IDLE:
Ha, ha, ha, I got him.

TERRY JONES:
Get on with it! Get on with it!

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, m'lud, on the 28th of May, you published this phrasebook.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I did.

ERIC IDLE:
I quote an example. The Hungarian phrase meaning 'Can you direct me to the station?' is translated by the English phrase, 'Please fondle my bum'.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I wish to plead incompetence.

Why on earth didn't you say why you wanted an adjourment?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I didn't know an acceptable legal phrase, m'lud.

ERIC IDLE:
Call Abigail Tesler

DIRECTION:
Two policemen carry a large photo blow-up the size of a door. It is a photo from a newspaper like the 'Mirror', with a girl in a bikini and the headline across the top: 'Sunshine Sizzler'. Underneath is some small print which is later read out (see below). They prop her up in the witness box.

JOHN CLEESE:
M'lud - this is Abigail Tesler.

TERRY JONES:
Is it?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, m'lud. Twenty-three-year-old Abigail hails from down under, where they're upside down about her. Those Aussies certainly know a thing or two when it comes to beach belles. Bet some life-saver wouldn't mind giving her the kiss of life. So watch out for sharks, Abigail!

DIRECTION:
Cut back to the judge's desk. The judge has turned into a similar photo blow-up of himself, the size of a door. The headline at the top is 'Legal Sizzler'.
