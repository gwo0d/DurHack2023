DIRECTION:
Cut to a pet shop.

DIRECTION:
SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'A PET SHOP SOMEWHERE NEAR MELTON MOWBRAY'

DIRECTION:
Man enters shop and approaches shopkeeper at counter.

JOHN CLEESE:
Good morning, I'd like to buy a cat.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Certainly sir. I've got a lovely terrier.

DIRECTION:
(indicates a box on the counter

DIRECTION:
glancing in box

JOHN CLEESE:
No, I want a cat really.

DIRECTION:
taking box off counter and then putting it back on counter as if it is a different box

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh yeah, how about that?

DIRECTION:
looking in box

JOHN CLEESE:
No, that's the terrier.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, it's as near as dammit.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well what do you mean? I want a cat.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Listen, tell you what. I'll file its legs down a bit, take its snout out, stick a few wires through its cheeks. There you are, a lovely pussy cat.

JOHN CLEESE:
Its not a proper cat.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What do you mean?

JOHN CLEESE:
Well it wouldn't meow.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well it would howl a bit.

JOHN CLEESE:
No, no, no, no. Er, have you got a parrot?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, I'm afraid not actually guv, we're fresh out of parrots. I'll tell you what though ... I'll lop its back legs off, make good, strip the fur, stick a couple of wings on and staple on a beak of your own choice.

DIRECTION:
taking small box and rattling it

MICHAEL PALIN:
No problem. Lovely parrot.

JOHN CLEESE:
How long would that take?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh, let me see ... er, stripping the fur off, no legs ...

DIRECTION:
calling

MICHAEL PALIN:
Harry ... can you do a parrot job on this terrier straight away?

DIRECTION:
off-screen

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No, I'm still putting a tuck in the Airedale, and then I got the frogs to let out.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Friday?

JOHN CLEESE:
No I need it for tomorrow. It's a present.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Oh dear, it's a long job. You see parrot conversion ... Tell you what though, for free, terriers make lovely fish. I mean I could do that for you straight away. Legs off, fins on, stick a little pipe through the back of its neck so it can breathe, bit of gold paint, make good ...

JOHN CLEESE:
You'd need a very big tank.

MICHAEL PALIN:
It's a great conversation piece.

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, all right, all right ... but, uh, only if I can watch.

DIRECTION:
Vox pops.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, I thought that was a bit predictable.

ERIC IDLE:
It's been done before

TERRY JONES:
Yeah, we did it for Caesar's Christmas Show.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
No you didn't, you did Jack and the Beanstalk.
