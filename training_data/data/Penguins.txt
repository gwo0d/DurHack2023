JOHN CLEESE:
Penguins, yes, penguins. What relevance do penguins have to the furtherance of medical science? Well, strangely enough quite a lot, a major breakthrough, maybe. It was from such an unlikely beginning as an unwanted fungus accidentally growing on a sterile plate that Sir Alexander Fleming gave the world penicillin. James Watt watched an ordinary household kettle boiling and conceived the potentiality of steam power. Would Albert Einstein ever have hit upon the theory of relativity if he hadn't been clever? All these tremendous leaps forward have been taken in the dark. Would Rutherford ever have split the atom if he hadn't tried? Could Marconi have invented the radio if he hadn't by pure chance spent years working at the problem? Are these amazing breakthroughs ever achieved except by years and years of unremitting study? Of course not. What I said earlier about accidental discoveries must have been wrong. Nevertheless scientists believe that these penguins, these comic flightless web-footed little bastards may finally unwittingly help man to fathom the uncharted depths of the human mind.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Hello. Here at the Institute Professor Charles Pasarell, Dr Peaches Bartkowicz and myself have been working on the theory originally postulated by the late Dr Kramer that the penguin is intrinsically more intelligent than the human being.

DIRECTION:
He moves over to a large diagram which is being held by two tennis players in full tennis kit but wearing the brown coats of ordinary laboratory technicians. The diagram shows a penguin and a man in correct proportional size with their comparative brain capacities marked out clearly showing the man's to be much larger than the penguin's.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
The first thing that Dr Kramer came up with was that the penguin has a much smaller brain than the man. This postulate formed the fundamental basis of all his thinking and remained with him until his death.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Now we've taken this theory one stage further. If we increase the size of the penguin until it is the same height as the man and then compare the relative brain sizes, we now find that the penguin's brain is still smaller. But, and this is the point, it is larger than it was.

MICHAEL PALIN:
For a penguin to have the same size of brain as a man the penguin would have to be over sixty-six feet high.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
This theory has become known as the waste of time theory and was abandoned in 1956.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
The BBC programme planners surprisingly high total here can be explained away as being within the ordinary limits of statistical error. One particularly dim programme planner can cock the whole thing up.

ERIC IDLE:
These IQ tests were thought to contain an unfair cultural bias against the penguin. For example, it didn't take into account the penguins extremely poor educational system. To devise a fairer system of test, a team of our researchers spent eighteen months in Antarctica living like penguins, and subsequently dying like penguins - only quicker - proving that the penguin is a clever little sod in his own environment.

DIRECTION:
Cut to the scientist.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Therefore we devised tests to be given to the penguins in the fourth set ... I do beg your pardon, in their own environment.

DIRECTION:
Net!

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Shh!

Cut to a professor and team surrounding penguins standing in a pool.

What is the next number in this sequence - 2, 4, 6. . .

DIRECTION:
A penguin squawks.

TERRY JONES:
Did he say eight? ...

TERRY JONES:
What is...

DIRECTION:
Cut back to the scientist.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
The environmental barrier had been removed but we'd hit another: the language barrier. The penguins could not speak English and were therefore unable to give the answers. This problem was removed in the next series of experiments by asking the same questions to the penguins and to a random group of non-English-speaking humans in the same conditions.

DIRECTION:
Cut to the professor and his team now surrounding a group of foreigners who are standing in a pool looking bewildered.

TERRY JONES:
What is the next number? 2, 4, 6...

DIRECTION:
long pause

ERIC IDLE:
. . . Hello?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
The results of these tests were most illuminating. The penguins scores were consistently equal to those of the non-English-speaking group.
