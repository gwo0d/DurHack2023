JOHN CLEESE:
Ah Mr Anchovy. Do sit down.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Thank you. Take the weight off the feet, eh?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, yes.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Lovely weather for the time of year, I must say.

JOHN CLEESE:
Enough of this gay banter. And now Mr Anchovy, you asked us to advise you which job in life you were best suited for.

MICHAEL PALIN:
That is correct, yes.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well I now have the results here of the interviews and the aptitude tests that you took last week, and from them we've built up a pretty clear picture of the sort of person that you are. And I think I can say, without fear of contradiction, that the ideal job for you is chartered accountancy.

MICHAEL PALIN:
But I

MICHAEL PALIN:
a chartered accountant.

JOHN CLEESE:
Jolly good. Well back to the office with you then.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No! No! No! You don't understand. I've been a chartered accountant for the last twenty years. I want a new job. Something

MICHAEL PALIN:
.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well chartered accountancy is rather exciting isn't it?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Exciting? No it's

MICHAEL PALIN:
. My God it's dull, it's so desperately dull and tedious and stuffy and boring and des-per-ate-ly DULL.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, er, yes Mr Anchovy, but you see your report here says that you are an extremely dull person. You see, our experts describe you as an appallingly dull fellow, unimaginative, timid, lacking in initiative, spineless, easily dominated, no sense of humour, tedious company and irrepressibly drab and awful. And whereas in most professions these would be considerable drawbacks, in chartered accountancy they are a positive boon.

MICHAEL PALIN:
But don't you see, I came here to find a new job, a new life, a new

MICHAEL PALIN:
to my existence. Can't you help me?

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, do you have any idea of what you want to do?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, yes I have.

JOHN CLEESE:
What?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Lion taming.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well yes. Yes. Of course, it's a bit of a jump isn't it? I mean, er, chartered accountancy to lion taming in one go. You don't think it might be better if you worked your way

JOHN CLEESE:
lion taming, say, via banking?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No, no, no, no. No. I don't want to wait. At nine o'clock tomorrow I want to be in there, taming.

JOHN CLEESE:
Fine, fine. But do you, do you have any qualifications?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, I've got a hat.

JOHN CLEESE:
A hat?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, a hat. A lion taming hat. A hat with 'lion tamer' on it. I got it at Harrods. And it lights up saying 'lion tamer' in great big neon letters, so that you can tame them after dark when they're less stroppy.

JOHN CLEESE:
I see, I see.

MICHAEL PALIN:
And you can switch it off during the day time, and claim reasonable wear and tear as allowable professional expenses under paragraph 335C...

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, yes, yes, I do follow, Mr Anchovy, but you see the snag is... if I now call Mr Chipperfield and say to him, 'look here, I've got a forty-five-year-old chartered accountant with me who wants to become a lion tamer', his first question is not going to be 'does he have his own hat?' He's going to ask what sort of experience you've had with lions.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well I ... I've seen them at the zoo.

JOHN CLEESE:
Good, good, good.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Lively brown furry things with short stumpy legs and great long noses. I don't know what all the fuss is about, I could tame one of those. They look pretty tame to start with.

JOHN CLEESE:
And these, er, these lions ... how high are they?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well they're about so high, you know. They don't frighten me at all.

JOHN CLEESE:
Really. And do these lions eat ants?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes, that's right.

JOHN CLEESE:
Er, well, Mr Anchovy ... I'm afraid what you've got hold of there is an anteater.

MICHAEL PALIN:
A what?

JOHN CLEESE:
An anteater. Not a lion. You see a lion is a huge savage beast, about five feet high, ten feet long, weighing about four hundred pounds, running forty miles per hour, with masses of sharp pointed teeth and nasty long razor-sharp claws that can rip your belly open before you can say 'Eric Robinson', and they look like this.

JOHN CLEESE:
Time enough I think for a piece of wood.

TERRY JONES:
The larch.

JOHN CLEESE:
Now, shall I call Mr Chipperfield?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Er, no, no, no. I think your idea of making the transition to lion taming via easy stages, say via insurance...

JOHN CLEESE:
Or banking.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Or banking, yes, yes, banking that's a man's life, isn't it? Banking, travel, excitement, adventure, thrills, decisions affecting people's lives.

JOHN CLEESE:
Jolly good, well, er, shall I put you in touch with a bank?

MICHAEL PALIN:
Yes.

JOHN CLEESE:
Fine.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Er... no, no, no. Look, er, it's a big decision, I'd like a couple of weeks to think about it... er... you know, don't want to jump into it too quickly. Maybe three weeks. I could let you know definitely then, I just don't want to make this definite decision. I'm er...

JOHN CLEESE:
Well this is just one of the all too many cases on our books of chartered accountancy. The only way that we can fight this terrible debilitating social disease, is by informing the general public of its consequences, by showing young people that it's just not worth it. So, so please... give generously... to this address: The League for Fighting Chartered Accountancy, 55 Lincoln House, Basil Street, London, SW3.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, well that was fun wasn't it?

TERRY JONES:
No it wasn't, you fairy.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh, hello sailor,

TERRY JONES:
Here, you wouldn't have got on one of our voyages - they were all dead butch.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh that's not what I've heard.
