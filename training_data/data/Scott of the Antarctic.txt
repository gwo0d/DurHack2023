ERIC IDLE:
Pretty strong meat there from Longueur who is saying, of course, that ultimately materialism, in this case the Webb's Wonder lettuce, must destroy us all. That was for O. Simon, K. Simon, P. Simon and R. Sparrow of Leicester. Later on, we're going to take a look at John Wayne's latest movie, 'Buckets of Blood Pouring Out of People's Heads' but now we look ahead. On Tuesday Chris Conger took a BBC film unit to the location where 20th Century Vole are shooting their latest epic 'Scott of the Antarctic'.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Sea, sand and sunshine make Paignton the queen of the English Riviera. But for the next six months this sleepy Devonshire resort will be transformed into the blizzard-swept wastes of the South Pole. For today shooting starts on the epic 'Scott of the Antarctic', produced by Gerry Schlick.

ERIC IDLE:
Hello.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Gerry, you chose Paignton as the location for Scott.

ERIC IDLE:
Right, right.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Isn't it a bit of a drawback that there's no snow here?

ERIC IDLE:
Well, we have 28,000 cubic feet of Wintrex, which is a new white foam rubber which actually on screen looks more like snow than snow...

ERIC IDLE:
... and 1,600 cubic US furlongs of white paint, with a special snow finish.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
And I believe Kirk Vilb is playing the title role.

ERIC IDLE:
That is correct. We were very thrilled and honoured when Kirk agreed to play the part of Lieutenant Scott

ERIC IDLE:
And directing we have a very fine young British director, James McRettin, who's been collaborating on the screenplay, of course Jimmy...

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, there you are. Hello. Hello. No problem. Have a drink. Have a drink. Great. Hello. Marvellous. Marvellous. Hello. Rewrite. Oh this is really great. I mean, it's really saying something, don't you think?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Have you started shooting yet?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, yes. Great. Perfect. No, no, we haven't started yet. No. But great - great.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
What is the first scene that you shoot this morning?

JOHN CLEESE:
Great. Terrific. Oh it's great. No problem. We'll sort it out on the floor. Sort it out on the floor. No problem. This film is basically pro-humanity and anti-bad things and it rips aside the hypocritical facade of our society's gin and tonic and leaves a lot of sacred cows rolling around in agony, have a drink, have a drink.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
But which

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
are we shooting first, Jimmy?

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, great. Oh, marvellous.

JOHN CLEESE:
I thought we cut that? Didn't we cut that?

ERIC IDLE:
No, we didn't.

JOHN CLEESE:
We didn't. Oh great. That's even better. I'll put it back in. Rewrite.

JOHN CLEESE:
This is the scene - outside the tent - it's all bloody marvelous. It makes you want to throw up.

ERIC IDLE:
Now in this scene Lieutenant Scott returns to camp in the early morning after walking the huskies to have brunch with the rest of his team.

ERIC IDLE:
Oates, played by your very own lovely Terence Lemming, who is an English cockney officer seconded to the US Navy, and Bowers played by Seymour Fortescue, the Olympic pole vaulter.

TERRY JONES:
Hi, Lieutenant.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Hi, Oatesy. Sure is a beautiful day already.

JOHN CLEESE:
Great, great.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What? What are you saying?

JOHN CLEESE:
I was just saying great, great. Cue Evans.

ERIC IDLE:
And this is Vanilla Hoare as Miss Evans.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Miss Evans?

ERIC IDLE:
Right.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good morning, Miss Evans.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh, I've forgotten my line.

JOHN CLEESE:
What's her line? What's her line?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Oh, yeah. 'Good morning, Captain Sc'..; oh, I'm just not really very happy with that line. Could I just say 'Hi Scottie'?

JOHN CLEESE:
Great. Great. Rewrite. Cue.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Hi Scarrie! Oh, sorry. Hi Stocky! Oh - I'm sorry again. Oh, Jim. I'm just unhappy with this line. Hey, can I do it all sort of kooky, like this?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Hi Scottie!

JOHN CLEESE:
Great! We'll shoot it.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Are you sure that's right?

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, it's great.

ERIC IDLE:
Jim.

JOHN CLEESE:
Jim! Jim! Oh, me!

ERIC IDLE:
Jim, I feel we may be running into some problems here in the area of height.

JOHN CLEESE:
Great! Where are they?

ERIC IDLE:
Where are who?

JOHN CLEESE:
I don't know. I was getting confused.

ERIC IDLE:
Jim, I feel here, that Scott may be too tall in the area of height with reference to Vanilla who is too near the ground in the area of being too short at this time.

JOHN CLEESE:
Great ... Oh, I know. I'm going to dig a pit for Scott and put a box in Vanilla's trench.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Say, why don't I take the boxes off and Vanilla get up out of the trench?

JOHN CLEESE:
It wouldn't work... It's even better! Great. Rewrite!

CAROL CLEVELAND:
What was that?

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, it's easy. I've worked it out. Scott takes his boxes off and you don't stand in the trench.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
I say my lines out of the trench?

JOHN CLEESE:
Even better. Great.

CAROL CLEVELAND:
But I've never acted out of a trench. I might fall over. It's dangerous.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh well, could you just try it?

CAROL CLEVELAND:
Look, you crumb bum, I'm a star. Star, star, star. I don't get a million dollars to act out of a trench. I played Miss St John the Baptist in a trench,

CAROL CLEVELAND:
I played Miss Galileo in a groove and I played Mrs Jesus Christ in a geological syncline, so don't...

JOHN CLEESE:
Great. Great everyone. Lunch now. Lunch. It's all in the can. Good morning's work.

ERIC IDLE:
But you haven't done a shot.

JOHN CLEESE:
Just keeping morale up.

ERIC IDLE:
Now this afternoon we're going to shoot the scene where Scott gets off the boat on to the ice floe and he sees the lion and he fights it and kills it and the blood goes pssssssssshhh in slow motion.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
But there aren't any lions in the Antarctic.

ERIC IDLE:
What?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
There aren't any lions in the Antarctic.

ERIC IDLE:
You're right. There are no lions in the Antarctic. That's ridiculous! Whoever heard of a lion in the Antarctic? Right. Lose the lion.

JOHN CLEESE:
Got to keep the lion. It's great!

ERIC IDLE:
Lose the lion.

JOHN CLEESE:
Great. We're losing the lion. Rewrite. Lose the lion everyone. That's fantastic.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What's this about our losing the lion?

ERIC IDLE:
Well, Kirk, we thought perhaps we might lose the fight with the lion a little bit, Kirk, angel.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Why?

ERIC IDLE:
Well, Kirkie, doll, there are no lions in the Antarctic, baby.

MICHAEL PALIN:
I get to fight the lion.

ERIC IDLE:
It'd be silly.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Listen, I gotta fight the lion. That's what that guy Scott's all about. I know. I've studied him already.

ERIC IDLE:
But why couldn't you fight a penguin?

JOHN CLEESE:
Great!

MICHAEL PALIN:
Fight a rotten penguin?

ERIC IDLE:
It needn't be a little penguin. It can be the biggest penguin you've ever seen. An electric penguin, twenty feet high, with long green tentacles that sting people, and you can stab it in the wings and the blood can go spurting psssssshhhh in slow motion.

MICHAEL PALIN:
The lion is in the contract.

ERIC IDLE:
He fights the lion.

JOHN CLEESE:
Even better. Great. Have a drink. Lose the penguin. Stand by to shoot.

ERIC IDLE:
Where do they have lions?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Africa.

ERIC IDLE:
That's it. Scott's in Africa. As many lions as we need.

ERIC IDLE:
He's looking for a pole no one else knows about. That ties in with the sand. Right. Paint the sand yellow again. Okay, let's get this show on the road. 'Scott of the Sahara.'
