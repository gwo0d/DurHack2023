Our panel this evening... Gurt Svensson, the Swedish mammal abuser and part-time radiator.

DIRECTION:
Cut to Svensson. He is standing on his head on the desk with his legs crossed in a yoga position. He wears a loincloth and high-heeled shoes. He talks through a megaphone which is strapped to his head.

TERRY JONES:
Good evening.

DIRECTION:
Cut back to the presenter.

ERIC IDLE:
Dame Elsie Occluded, historian, wit, bon viveur, and rear half of the Johnson brothers...

DIRECTION:
Cut to another section of the panel's desk. Dame Elsie. Her bottom half is encased in the side of a block of concrete which is also on top of the desk. Dame Elsie is thus parallel to the ground. She has fairy wings on her back, a striped t-shirt, flying gloves, goggles and a green wig.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good evening.

And Miles Yellowbird, up high in banana tree, the golfer and inventor of Catholicism.

Good evening.

ERIC IDLE:
And we'll be inviting them to... Spot the Loony.

DIRECTION:
a phone rings on the desk; he picks it up

ERIC IDLE:
Yes? Quite right ... A viewer from Preston there who's pointed out correctly that the entire panel are loonies. Five points to Preston there, and on to our first piece of film. It's about mountaineering and remember you have to... Spot the Loony!

DIRECTION:
Cut to a shot of a mountain. Very impressive stirring music.

MICHAEL PALIN:
The legendary south face of Ben Medhui, dark ... forbidding...

DIRECTION:
In the middle distance are two bushes a few yards apart. At this point a loony dressed in a long Roman toga, with tam o'shanter, holding a cricket bat, runs from one bush to the other. Loud buzz. The film freezes. Pull out from screen to reveal the freeze frame of the film with the loony in the middle bush on the screen immediately behind the presenter. The presenter is on the phone.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, well done, Mrs Nesbitt of York, spotted the loony in 1.8 seconds.

DIRECTION:
cut to a photo of Anthony Barber; the buzzer goes immediately

ERIC IDLE:
No ... I must ask you please not to ring in until you've seen all the photos.

DIRECTION:
Back to the photo sequence and music. Each photo is on the screen for only two seconds, and in between each there is a click as of a slide projector changing or even the sound of the shutter of a camera. The photos show in sequence: Anthony Barber, Katy Boyle, Edgar Allan Poe, a loony head and shoulders. He has ping-pong ball eyes, several teeth blocked out, a fright wig and his chest is bare but across it is written 'A Loony', Reginald Maudling, Tony Jacklin. A buzzer sounds.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, you're right. The answer was, of course, number two!

DIRECTION:

DIRECTION:
fanfare as for historical pageant; a historical-looking shield comes up on screen

DIRECTION:
historical music

ERIC IDLE:
And this time it's the thrilling medieval romance 'Ivanoe'... a stirring story of love and war, violence and chivalry, set midst the pageantry and splendour of thirteenth-century England. All you have to do is, 'Spot the Loony'.

DIRECTION:
CAPTION: 'IVANOE'

DIRECTION:
Cut to a butcher shop. A loony stands in the middle

DIRECTION:
this is the same loony from 'Silly Election' with enormous trousers and arms inside them and green fright wig

DIRECTION:
. Another loony in a long vest down to his knees with a little frilly tutu starting at the knees and bare feet is dancing with a side of beef also wearing a tutu. Another loony in oilskins with waders and sou'wester and fairy wings is flying across the top of picture. Another man dressed us a bee is standing on the counter. Another loony is dressed as a carrot leaning against the counter going: 'pretty boy, pretty boy'. A cocophony of noise. We see this sight for approximately five seconds. Fantastic loud buzzes.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, well done, Mrs L of Leicester, Mrs B of Buxton and Mrs G of Gotwick, the loony was of course the writer, Sir Walter Scott.

DIRECTION:
Cut to Sir Walter Scott in his study.
