ERIC IDLE:
And welcome to 'Spot the Loony', where once again we invite you to come with us all over the world to meet all kinds of people in all kinds of places, and ask you to . .. Spot the Loony!

ERIC IDLE:
Our panel this evening... Gurt Svensson, the Swedish mammal abuser and part-time radiator.

TERRY JONES:
Good evening.

ERIC IDLE:
Dame Elsie Occluded, historian, wit, bon viveur, and rear half of the Johnson brothers...

MICHAEL PALIN:
Good evening.

ERIC IDLE:
And Miles Yellowbird, up high in banana tree, the golfer and inventor of Catholicism.

TERRY GILLIAM:
Good evening.

ERIC IDLE:
And we'll be inviting them to... Spot the Loony.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes? Quite right ... A viewer from Preston there who's pointed out correctly that the entire panel are loonies. Five points to Preston there, and on to our first piece of film. It's about mountaineering and remember you have to... Spot the Loony!

MICHAEL PALIN:
The legendary south face of Ben Medhui, dark ... forbidding...

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, well done, Mrs Nesbitt of York, spotted the loony in 1.8 seconds.

ERIC IDLE:
No ... I must ask you please not to ring in until you've seen all the photos.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, you're right. The answer was, of course, number two!

ERIC IDLE:
And this time it's the thrilling medieval romance 'Ivanoe'... a stirring story of love and war, violence and chivalry, set midst the pageantry and splendour of thirteenth-century England. All you have to do is, 'Spot the Loony'.

ERIC IDLE:
Yes, well done, Mrs L of Leicester, Mrs B of Buxton and Mrs G of Gotwick, the loony was of course the writer, Sir Walter Scott.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I didn't write that! Sounds more like Dickens...

TERRY JONES:
You bastard!
