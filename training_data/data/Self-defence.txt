JOHN CLEESE:
Sir! Good evening, class.

JOHN CLEESE:
Where's all the others, then?

JOHN CLEESE:
I can see that. What's the matter with them?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Perhaps they've got flu.

JOHN CLEESE:
Flu...flu? They should eat more fresh fruit.

JOHN CLEESE:
Right. Now, self-defence. Tonight I shall be carrying on from where we got to last week when I was showing you how to defend yourselves against anyone who attacks you with armed with a piece of fresh fruit.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You promised you wouldn't do fruit this week.

JOHN CLEESE:
What do you mean?

TERRY JONES:
We've done fruit the last nine weeks.

JOHN CLEESE:
What's wrong with fruit? You think you know it all, eh?

MICHAEL PALIN:
But couldn't we do something else, for a change?

ERIC IDLE:
Like someone who attacks you with a pointed stick?

JOHN CLEESE:
What?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
We've done the passion fruit.

MICHAEL PALIN:
We done oranges, apples, grapefruits.

TERRY JONES:
Whole and segments.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Pomegranates, greengages.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Grapes, passion fruit.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Lemons.

TERRY JONES:
Plums.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Yes, and mangoes in syrup.

JOHN CLEESE:
How about cherries?

JOHN CLEESE:
Red

JOHN CLEESE:
black?

JOHN CLEESE:
All right then...bananas!

JOHN CLEESE:
We haven't done them, have we?

JOHN CLEESE:
Right! Bananas! How to defend yourself against a man armed with a banana.

JOHN CLEESE:
Now, it's quite simple to defend yourself against the banana fiend. First of all, you force him to drop the banana, next, you eat the banana, thus disarming him. You have now rendered him helpless.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Suppose he's got a bunch.

JOHN CLEESE:
Shut up!

ERIC IDLE:
Supposing he's got a pointed stick.

JOHN CLEESE:
Shut up. Right now you, Mr Apricot.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Harrison.

JOHN CLEESE:
Harrison, Mr. Harrison. Come at me with that banana then. Come on attack me with it. As hard as you like. Come on.

JOHN CLEESE:
Now...I eat the banana.

JOHN CLEESE:
I have now eaten the banana. The deceased Mr Apricot is now disarmed.

MICHAEL PALIN:
You shot him. You shot him dead.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, he was attacking me with a banana.

TERRY JONES:
Well, you told him to.

JOHN CLEESE:
Look, I'm only doing me job. I have to show you how to defend yourselves against fresh fruit.

ERIC IDLE:
And pointed sticks.

JOHN CLEESE:
Shut up.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Supposing someone came at you with a banana and you haven't got a gun?

JOHN CLEESE:
Run for it.

TERRY JONES:
You could stand and scream for help.

JOHN CLEESE:
You try that with a pineapple down your windpipe.

TERRY JONES:
A pineapple?

JOHN CLEESE:
Where? Where?

TERRY JONES:
Nowhere. I was just saying pineapple.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh blimey. I thought my number was on that one.

TERRY JONES:
What, on the pineapple?

TERRY JONES:
No I was just repeating it.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh. Oh. Right. That's the banana then. Next... the raspberry.

JOHN CLEESE:
Harmless looking thing, isn't it? Now you, Mr Tinned Peach...

TERRY JONES:
Thompson.

JOHN CLEESE:
Mr Thompson, come at me with that raspberry then. Come on, be as vicious as you like with it.

TERRY JONES:
No.

JOHN CLEESE:
Why not?

TERRY JONES:
You'll shoot me.

JOHN CLEESE:
I won't.

TERRY JONES:
You shot Mr. Harrison.

JOHN CLEESE:
That was self-defence. Come on. I promise I won't shoot you.

ERIC IDLE:
You promised you'd tell us about pointed sticks.

JOHN CLEESE:
Shut up. Now. Brandish that...brandish that raspberry. Come on, be as vicious as you like with it. Come on.

TERRY JONES:
No. Throw the gun away.

JOHN CLEESE:
I haven't got a gun.

TERRY JONES:
Oh yes, you have.

JOHN CLEESE:
I haven't.

TERRY JONES:
You have. You shot Mr Harrison with it.

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh...

JOHN CLEESE:
gun.

TERRY JONES:
Throw it away.

JOHN CLEESE:
All right.

JOHN CLEESE:
How to defend yourself against a raspberry, without a gun.

TERRY JONES:
You were going to shoot me!

JOHN CLEESE:
I wasn't.

TERRY JONES:
You were.

JOHN CLEESE:
Wasn't. Come on, come on you worm...you miserable little man. Come at me then...come on, do your worst, you worm.

JOHN CLEESE:
If anyone ever attacks you with a raspberry, simply pull the lever...and a sixteen-ton weight will drop on his head. I learnt that in Malaya.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Suppose you haven't got a sixteen-ton weight?

JOHN CLEESE:
Well that's planning, isn't it? Forethought.

MICHAEL PALIN:
How many sixteen-ton weights are there?

JOHN CLEESE:
Look...look, smarty pants, the sixteen-ton weight is just one way of dealing with the raspberry killer. There are millions of others!

ERIC IDLE:
Like what?

JOHN CLEESE:
Shoot him.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Well, supposing you haven't got a gun or a sixteen-ton weight?

JOHN CLEESE:
All right clever dick, all right clever dick. You two, come at me with raspberries, there you are, a whole basket each. Come on, come at me with them, then.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No gun?

JOHN CLEESE:
No.

MICHAEL PALIN:
No sixteen-ton weight?

ERIC IDLE:
No pointed stick?

MICHAEL PALIN:
No rocks up in the ceiling?

MICHAEL PALIN:
You won't kill us.

JOHN CLEESE:
I won't kill you.

MICHAEL PALIN:
Promise.

JOHN CLEESE:
I promise I won't kill you. Now, are you going to attack me?

JOHN CLEESE:
Right, now don't rush me this time. I'm going to turn me back. So you can stalk me...right. Come up as quietly as you can, right, close up behind me, then, in with the raspberries, right? Start moving

JOHN CLEESE:
Right...I know you're there - lurking under the floorboards with your damsons and your prunes...now, the rest of you - I know you're hiding behind the wall bars with your quinces. Well I'm ready for you. I've wired myself up to two hundred tons of gelignite, and if any one of you so much as tries anything we'll all go up together! I've warned you...I warned you, right. That's it...

ERIC IDLE:
And did those feet in ancient times, walk upon England's mountains green...we'd like to alter the mood a little, we'd like to bring you something for mum and dad, Annie, and Roger, Mazarin and Louis and all at Versailles, it's a little number calld 'England's Mountains Green'. Hope you like it. And did those feet in ancient time...

JOHN CLEESE:
Yes, you know it's a man's life in England's Mountain Green.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Right I heard that, I heard that, I'm going to stop this sketch now, and if there's any more of this, I'm going to stop the whole programme. I thought it was supposed to be about teeth anyway. Why don't you do something about your teeth - go on.

JOHN CLEESE:
What about my rustic monologue?...I'm not sleeping with

JOHN CLEESE:
producer again.

JOHN CLEESE:
Excitement, drama, action, violence, fresh fruit. Passion. Thrills. Spills. Romance. Adventure, all the things you can read about in a book.
