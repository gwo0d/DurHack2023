CAPTION: 'A PARTY POLITICAL BROADCAST ON BEHALF OF THE WOOD PARTY'

JOHN CLEESE:
There now follows a Party Political Broadcast on behalf of the Wood Party.

DIRECTION:
Cut to a traditional grey-suited man at desk looking straight into camera.

DIRECTION:
SUPERIMPOSED CAPTION: 'THE RT. HON. LAMBERT WARBECK'

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Good evening. We in the Wood Party feel very strongly that the present weak drafting of the Local Government Bill leaves a lot to be desired, and we intend to fight.

DIRECTION:
He thumps on the desk and he falls through the floor. (Yes Mr Director you did read that right: he fell through the floor and added a fortune to the budget). As he falls he emits a long scream, fading away slowly. Another man comes and looks down into the pit.

ERIC IDLE:
Hello Helllllllllloooooooooo!

DIRECTION:
to camera

DIRECTION:
goes and looks at pit

ERIC IDLE:
Helloooo.

DIRECTION:
unseen, a long way down

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Helloooooo.

ERIC IDLE:
Are you all right minister?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I appear to have landed on this kind of ledge thing.

ERIC IDLE:
Shall we lower down one of the BBC ropes?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
If you'd be so kind.

ERIC IDLE:
What length of BBC rope will we be likely to need?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I should use the longest BBC rope. That would be a good idea I would imagine.

ERIC IDLE:
Okey doke chief. Er, Tex get the longest BBC rope, and bring it here pronto.

DIRECTION:
still a long way down

DIRECTION:
man drops the script down and Tex appears with enormous coil of rope

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
The script would appear to have landed on a different ledge somewhat out of my grasp, don't you know.

ERIC IDLE:
Er, well perhaps when the rope reaches you minister you could kind of swing over to the ledge and grab it.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Good idea.

DIRECTION:
Cut to minister swinging on rope.

DIRECTION:
CAPTION: 'THE RT. HON. LAMBERT WARBECK'

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well I'm going to carry on, if I can read the script.

DIRECTION:
He swings over to a ledge opposite with a script on it. As he gets near he peers and starts reading.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Good evening. We in the Wood Party

DIRECTION:
he swings away and then back

DIRECTION:
swings away and back

DIRECTION:
he swings over and grabs the script with one hand; he turns to camera and continues

DIRECTION:
he makes a vigorous gesture and in so doing lets go of rope and slips so that he is now hanging upside down

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
agh, agh. Oh dear. Hello!

DIRECTION:
out of vision

ERIC IDLE:
Hello.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Look, look, I must look a bit of a chump hanging upside down like this.

DIRECTION:
cut to man looking off-camera

ERIC IDLE:
I think love if we turn the picture upside down we should help the minister, then.

DIRECTION:
Cut to minister. The picture is now the other way up. The minister now appears to be the right way up.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh good. Look, er, I'm sorry about this, but there seem to be a few gremlins about... I think I'd better start from the beginning. Er, good evening, we in the Wood Party feel very strongly about, oh ...

DIRECTION:
he drops script

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Bloody heck. Oh, oh dear, er terribly sorry about this, about saying bloody heck on all channels, but, er...

ERIC IDLE:
There's another script on the way down minister.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh good, good. Well ... er... er... um... Good evening. Er ... well... er... how are you? Er... Oh yes look, I don't want you to think of the Wood Party as a load of old men that like hanging around on ropes only I ... er ... oh ... oh.

DIRECTION:
Meanwhile a man, the right way up, has been lowered down to the minister. As the picture is reversed, he appears to be moving straight up towards him. The minister sees him.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ah. Thank you.

DIRECTION:
taking script; the man on the rope starts to climb back up

DIRECTION:
man falls past with a scream

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Look. I think we'd better call it a day.

DIRECTION:
Cut to two men at a desk in a discussion set.

TERRY JONES:
Is this the furthest distance that a minister has fallen? Robert.

DIRECTION:
Cut to Robert.

ERIC IDLE:
Well surprisingly not. The Canadian Minister for External Affairs fell nearly seven miles during a Liberal Conference in Ottawa about six years ago, and then quite recently the Kenyan Minister for Agric. and Fish fell nearly twelve miles during a Nairobi debate in Parliament, although this hasn't been ratified yet.

TERRY JONES:
Er, how far did the Filipino cabinet fall last March?

ERIC IDLE:
Er, well they fell nearly thirty-nine miles but it's not really so remarkable as that was due to their combined weight, of course. Robert.

TERRY JONES:
Thank you, Robert. Well now what's your reaction to all this, Robert?

DIRECTION:
Cut to third Robert who is staring intently into camera. He is wearing a fright wig and has a left eyebrow four inches above his right one.

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, well Robert the main thing is that it's terribly exciting. You see the minister is quite clearly lodged between rocks we know terribly little of. Terribly little. Of course the main thing is we're getting colour pictures of an extraordinarily high quality. The important thing is, the really exciting thing is the minister will

DIRECTION:
as he gets more excited he starts to emit smoke

DIRECTION:
he bursts into fire and someone has to throw a buckets of water over him

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, oh I needed that.

DIRECTION:
Cut back to first Robert.

TERRY JONES:
Thank you Robert. Well that seems to be about all we have time for tonight. Unless anyone has anything else to say. Has anyone anything else to say?

DIRECTION:
Various 'noes' plus one 'bloody fairy' and more noes, from a very rapid montage of all the possible characters in this week's show saying 'no'. The last one we come to is the Spectrum presenter. He says more than no.

MICHAEL PALIN:
What do we mean by no, what do we mean by yes, what do we mean by no, no, no. Tonight Spectrum looks at the whole question of what is no.

DIRECTION:
The sixteen-ton weight falls on him. Cut to 'It's' man running away.
