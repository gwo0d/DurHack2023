JOHN CLEESE:
There now follows a Party Political Broadcast on behalf of the Wood Party.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Good evening. We in the Wood Party feel very strongly that the present weak drafting of the Local Government Bill leaves a lot to be desired, and we intend to fight.

ERIC IDLE:
Hello Helllllllllloooooooooo!

ERIC IDLE:
Helloooo.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Helloooooo.

ERIC IDLE:
Are you all right minister?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I appear to have landed on this kind of ledge thing.

ERIC IDLE:
Shall we lower down one of the BBC ropes?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
If you'd be so kind.

ERIC IDLE:
What length of BBC rope will we be likely to need?

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
I should use the longest BBC rope. That would be a good idea I would imagine.

ERIC IDLE:
Okey doke chief. Er, Tex get the longest BBC rope, and bring it here pronto.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
The script would appear to have landed on a different ledge somewhat out of my grasp, don't you know.

ERIC IDLE:
Er, well perhaps when the rope reaches you minister you could kind of swing over to the ledge and grab it.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Good idea.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Well I'm going to carry on, if I can read the script.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Good evening. We in the Wood Party

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
agh, agh. Oh dear. Hello!

ERIC IDLE:
Hello.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Look, look, I must look a bit of a chump hanging upside down like this.

ERIC IDLE:
I think love if we turn the picture upside down we should help the minister, then.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh good. Look, er, I'm sorry about this, but there seem to be a few gremlins about... I think I'd better start from the beginning. Er, good evening, we in the Wood Party feel very strongly about, oh ...

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Bloody heck. Oh, oh dear, er terribly sorry about this, about saying bloody heck on all channels, but, er...

ERIC IDLE:
There's another script on the way down minister.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Oh good, good. Well ... er... er... um... Good evening. Er ... well... er... how are you? Er... Oh yes look, I don't want you to think of the Wood Party as a load of old men that like hanging around on ropes only I ... er ... oh ... oh.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Ah. Thank you.

GRAHAM CHAPMAN:
Look. I think we'd better call it a day.

TERRY JONES:
Is this the furthest distance that a minister has fallen? Robert.

ERIC IDLE:
Well surprisingly not. The Canadian Minister for External Affairs fell nearly seven miles during a Liberal Conference in Ottawa about six years ago, and then quite recently the Kenyan Minister for Agric. and Fish fell nearly twelve miles during a Nairobi debate in Parliament, although this hasn't been ratified yet.

TERRY JONES:
Er, how far did the Filipino cabinet fall last March?

ERIC IDLE:
Er, well they fell nearly thirty-nine miles but it's not really so remarkable as that was due to their combined weight, of course. Robert.

TERRY JONES:
Thank you, Robert. Well now what's your reaction to all this, Robert?

JOHN CLEESE:
Well, well Robert the main thing is that it's terribly exciting. You see the minister is quite clearly lodged between rocks we know terribly little of. Terribly little. Of course the main thing is we're getting colour pictures of an extraordinarily high quality. The important thing is, the really exciting thing is the minister will

JOHN CLEESE:
Oh, oh I needed that.

TERRY JONES:
Thank you Robert. Well that seems to be about all we have time for tonight. Unless anyone has anything else to say. Has anyone anything else to say?

MICHAEL PALIN:
What do we mean by no, what do we mean by yes, what do we mean by no, no, no. Tonight Spectrum looks at the whole question of what is no.
